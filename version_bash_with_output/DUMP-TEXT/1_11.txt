Concerns growing about the number of underage boys being abused in Dublin
brothels

A number of suspected brothels have been raided by gardaí in the last year.

   SINCE GARDAÍ RAIDED a suspected brothel in Dublin in March this year,
   concerns have been raised with them about the possibility of a number
   of underage boys being abused elsewhere in the city.

   It is now understood that complaints were made to gardaí about
   teenagers as young as 16 being exploited in a number of areas of north
   Dublin. Some of the information gathered by gardaí has come from adult
   escorts working elsewhere, and independently, in the capital.

   Many of the all-male brothels thought to be involved are located near
   the IFSC and Parnell Street. They use online advertisements and sales
   websites, as well as one well-known escort website, to promote their
   services.

   Information was passed on to An Garda Síochána based in Kilmainham in
   relation to the existence of the brothels following a raid of a
   different premises seven months ago.

   A quantity of cocaine was seized at this building in the north of the
   city.

   Most of the adult male escorts working in Ireland currently are
   Brazilian but there is a growing number of young Irish men, both adult
   and underage, in prostitution.

   Ruhama – an advocacy group which supports people as they exit
   prostitution – said it is aware of a number of male brothels in
   operation in Ireland and confirmed that it had helped young Irish
   minors escape.

   The organisation has confirmed that the name of the alleged ringleader
   has come to their attention but would not comment on specific queries.

   Sarah Benson, Ruhama’s CEO, told TheJournal.ie: “Ruhama is primarily a
   women’s support service given the highly gendered nature of the sex
   trade.

   However, we do engage with a small number of men each year, and have
   encountered men who have been exploited as minors. The sex trade is a
   dangerous and precarious environment for anyone regardless of gender or
   age.

   “We are aware of small numbers of men in prostitution at present in
   Ireland and they often come from the similarly marginalised backgrounds
   to the hundreds of women we meet each year. Their support needs can be
   significant and we will always do what we can to assist them.

   “In all instances where minors are prostituted this is child sexual
   exploitation and should be treated as such by the authorities – there
   is no such thing as a ‘child prostitute’.”

   A factor in the increasing presence of all-male brothels it the
   growing chemsex phenomenon in Dublin.

   According to one male escort, JP*, whoTheJournal.ie spoke to this week,
   many of the brothels are used for chemsex.

   Chemsex is the use of drugs such as G, crystal methamphetamine,
   ketamine and mephedrone to enhance sexual activity. The practice is
   usually associated with men who have sex with men (MSM), often involves
   multiple people and can lead to sexual encounters that last for hours
   or days.

   GHB is a synthetic drug used as an anaesthetic. It comes in a clear
   liquid or powder form and its potency varies. GBL is sold as a
   substitute for GHB. It’s found in cleaning solvents and converts to GHB
   when you swallow it.

   JP explained that short-term lets are being used to facilitate
   independent operations, like his. He counts it as lucky if there is an
   apartment to lease closer to the main entrance door – this means that
   their clients can enter and exit without drawing too much attention.

   However, larger brothels move to new locations more frequently due to
   the increased volume of people using them.

   New laws which took effect last year criminalised the purchase of sex
   in Ireland and many workers have said this has resulted in them working
   on their own, depriving them of security previously available to them.

   Those opposed to the legislation, including the Sex Workers Alliance
   Ireland (SWAI), said that it would make the job of the worker a lot
   more dangerous and that the demand for sex would not be reduced as a
   result.

   for the purposes of this article.
