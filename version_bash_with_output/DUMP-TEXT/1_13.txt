   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -

   The Youngstown Diocese is making public a list of priests who have been
   removed from their ministries over credible allegations of sexual
   abuse.

   At a 10 am Tuesday news conference, Bishop George Murry announced that
   of the more than 1,000 men who have been priests and other religious
   leaders in the five-county diocese since it was founded in 1943, 31 men
   have been found to have had credible inappropriate incidents.

   Bishop Murry said former FBI agents investigated 73 complaints about
   alleged abuse in the Diocese.

   The investigators make recommendations to the bishop and a board made
   of attorneys, Catholic and Lutheran pastors, representatives from
   Children Services and others.

   Bishop Murry tells 21 News that legal counsel advised the diocese to
   only release the names of the priests, and not what parishes they
   worked at, or when they served there.

   However, Murry says he has since chosen to defy legal counsel and will
   furnish a list of the parishes each priest or clergyperson worked at.
   21 News will be providing an update once those parishes are made
   public.

   Clergy of the Diocese of Youngstown against whom credible,
   substantiated allegations of sexual abuse of a minor have been made:

   Robert Burns

   John Ryan (deceased)

   Robert Sabatino  (deceased)

   Louis Santucci

   John Schmidt (deceased)

   William Smaltz

   John Warner

   Francis Zapitelli  (deceased)

   John P. Cunningham

   Gerald Curran

   Joseph Galganski

   Henry Gallagher

   John Gallagher

   James Hennessey

   Gerald Dupont, OP

   Donald Marrokal, CR (deceased)

   Giles Nealen, OSB (deceased)

   allegations of sexual abuse of a minor have been made and who have
   subsequently reside in the territory of the  Diocese of Youngstown.

     Robert Castelucci (Diocese of Pittsburgh)

     Anthony Cipola    (Diocese of Pittsburgh, deceased)

   Non-Clergy from Religious Orders against whom credible, substantiated
   allegations of sexual abuse of a minor have been made while employed in
   the Diocese of Youngstown:

   Stephen Baker, TOR (deceased)

   RELATED COVERAGE: Bishop apologizes to victims of sexual abuse

   The bishop has said that all of the parishes and schools where the
   priests in question had been stationed were notified in writing and
   were invited to contact the diocese if they knew of someone who had
   been abused or abused themselves.

   The Bishop is asking anyone who has been abused to come forward and
   speak with the diocese victim assistance coordinator retired Sergeant
   Delphine Baldwin-Casey at 330-718-1388.”

   Bishop Murry says he has welcomed Mahoning County Prosecutor Paul Gains
   to review files that the Diocese has on priests who have been credibly
   accused of sexual abuse.

   Bishop Murry said that in many cases, victims declined to prosecute
   their alleged abusers. Instead, saying they just wanted them out of the
   ministry.

   Below is a portion of the news release from the Diocese:

     Bishop George V. Murry, S.J., of the Catholic Diocese of Youngstown
     has announced the list of names of those who have served in the
     Diocese of Youngstown since its establishment in 1943 who have been
     credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor and who have been
     reported to civil authorities.

     Bishop Murry states, “I am very sorry that the Church has failed to
     act aggressively to eliminate this evil. I humbly ask forgiveness
     from the victims and their families for the grave mistakes the
     Church has made.”

     For the purpose of this list a “credible accusation” against a
     priest or deacon who has served in the Diocese of Youngstown is an
     accusation that, after a thorough investigation and review of
     available information, appears more likely true than not in the
     judgment of the Diocesan Review Board, and is accepted as credible
     by the bishop.

     The Diocese of Youngstown is committed to comply with local law
     enforcement and with the Charter for the Protection of Children and
     Young People established by the United States Conference of Catholic
     Bishops in 2002. The Charter contains a comprehensive set of
     procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by
     Catholic clergy, along with areas that assist the diocese in efforts
     to provide preventive measures designed to keep minors safe from
     harm now and in the future. Also included are guidelines for
     reconciliation, healing and accountability.

     Through ongoing education, the Diocese of Youngstown strives to
     empower people to create and maintain safe environments for our
     children and youth. Bishop Murry explained, “that as painful as the
     process of voluntary disclosure of names is for parishioners where
     these men served, this is one way that we can offer support and
     dignity to the survivors of clergy sexual abuse and their families.”

     This list will be supplemented based upon any future determinations
     of credible allegations.

   Youngstown is one of several dioceses around the country promising to
   release the names of clergy members accused of abuse.
