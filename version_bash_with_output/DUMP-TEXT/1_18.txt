Sexual Abuse and Neglect Allegations Swarm Chicago Hospital

Uptown Chicago Psychiatric Hospital “Called Out” After Reports of Sexual
Abuse and Neglect Involving Child Patients

   Although not surprised, the entire legal team at Levin & Perconti has
   been cringing over the recent ProPublica Illinois investigation into
   Chicago Lakeshore Hospital, a private psychiatric facility located in
   the northside of the city. The initial ProPublica findings involve both
   claims of sexual abuse and related disruptions grown from the ongoing
   neglect of young patients in the hospital’s Child and Adolescent
   Behavioral Health Program. The allegations are horrific to say the
   least. Even so, dozens of children have bravely stepped forward and
   shared their personal stories of being raped and sexually abused by
   staff and patients, while others have been physically assaulted. Many
   of the hospital’s hotline complaints in just the last few months were
   triggered from laxed staff who created scenes of abusive sexual
   activity (most forced), and inappropriate or violent altercations
   between children and teenage patients.

   Federal inspection reports in 2018, show the Illinois Department of
   Children and Family Services (DCFS) has investigated 16 allegations of
   abuse and neglect, many sexual in nature, at the hospital between staff
   and child patients, and other hospital residents just this year. As the
   Chicago Tribune recently reported, some pending investigations include
   these sickening allegations:
     * “A 7-year-old girl said a 12-year-old boy pulled down her pants and
       sexually assaulted her with a finger. At the time of the Sept. 10
       incident, the girl had been hospitalized for more than two months
       for homicidal and suicidal behaviors. The boy, who had a history of
       sexual aggression, had been hospitalized for nearly three months.”

     * “…two females accused a male staff member of touching them
       inappropriately. She said the worker kissed her and sexually
       assaulted her with his finger in early September. The other girl,
       who is 12, told a counselor the man touched her breast in late
       August. DCFS and Chicago police are still investigating.”

     * “In April, a 15-year-old patient complained the same worker made
       her feel uncomfortable after he made sexually suggestive comments,
       including that he wanted to be her roommate. The child welfare
       agency determined her complaint was unfounded.”

     * “The mother of an 8-year-old boy called the hotline Sept. 9
       alleging her son was battered by peers, touched sexually and
       exposed to two masturbating roommates during the five days he was
       hospitalized.”

   DCFS investigated and found these 2018 claims credible:
     * “A 10-year-old girl complained her 11-year-old female roommate
       asked her to have sex and was touching other girls in their unit in
       a sexual manner. When questioned, the 11-year-old reported having
       sexual experiences at a previous hospital and at home.”

     * “An April complaint was from the mother of a 17-year-old patient
       with intellectual and mental health issues. The boy suffered a
       bloody mouth and facial cuts and bruising after two staff members
       dragged him to his bedroom and threatened to break his arm while
       pinning him down on his bed, with his arms held over the bed rail,
       according to documents.”

     * “A 12-year-old boy said he was sexually abused by an older teen.
       Several other patients also complained about the teenage boy, who
       was then sent to the juvenile detention center. DCFS found the
       hospital had provided inadequate supervision during the incidents.”

   But because DCFS says it does not carry the authority to regulate the
   private psychiatric hospital which is inspected, licensed and certified
   by state and federal health officials, fixes to prevent these abuse and
   neglect situations in the first place have proven to be inadequate and
   continue to fail the estimated 300 DCFS child and teen patients who are
   treated and hospitalized at the facility each year.

   Chicago Lakeshore has been at risk of losing state and federal funding
   over the many similar abuse and neglect allegations health officials
   have been lurking over – for what feels like years in a repeated
   fashion. State and federal inspectors have also docked the facility for
   the lack of patient monitoring and access to empty rooms, and failed
   documentation of medical history and improper medication use.

Child Patients at Psychiatric Hospitals May Not Have a Home

   Chicago Lakeshore employs about 400 staff members each year,
   responsible for the care and treatment of an estimated 5,000 patients,
   a mix between adults and youth. Most of the children, some as young as
   3-years-old, arrive at the hospital under state care to be treated for
   mental health and abuse and neglect issues at home, only to find
   themselves frequently stuck in the facility’s system and unnecessarily
   hospitalized after so-called treatment has finished simply because DCFS
   has nowhere else to place them. Many of these young patients are
   low-income children with an already traumatic history of abuse and
   neglect, or drug and alcohol addictions.

   Since ProPublica’s report went live, and many victims have come forward
   to share personal attack stories, the American Civil Liberties Union of
   Illinois (ACLU) as well as several state lawmakers, became involved.
   The ACLU is threatening to take DCFS into court if the agency doesn’t
   take immediate action to ensure kids are safe by putting an immediate
   hold on future admissions to Chicago Lakeshore and transfer current
   patients to other treatment centers. Levin & Perconti applaud these
   many groups and lawmakers who have called for DCFS to conduct an
   independent investigation, as well as ProPublica for reporting the
   findings.

   These stories are beyond sensitive and reviewed with the most delicate
   appreciation of others’ feelings. No patient, especially a child,
   should endure this type of treatment and no one should get away with
   allowing it to continue one day further. Our team will unremittingly
   follow this investigation as it proceeds to unfold.
