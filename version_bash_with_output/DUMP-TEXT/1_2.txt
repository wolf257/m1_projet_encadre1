Charleston Diocese priest accused of sexual abuse in civil lawsuit spanning
two states

   CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) —

   A man sexually assaulted by a priest in Georgia now says it wasn't just
   one, but two priests who abused him as a child, He claims the second
   priest was a pastor from the Diocese of Charleston .

   Our story starts in Savannah, Georgia. “Everybody I knew was Catholic,”
   Chris Templeton said, one of five children growing up in Savannah in
   the 80s.

   “I was 4th generation Irish Catholic in Savannah and we lived in a
   neighborhood right across the street from the church.”

   His parents were active in Savannah's St. James Catholic Church and
   School, a member of the templeton kids attended St. James for 27
   straight years.

   “There was a six, seven or eight groups of us that all during the
   summer went to St. James' field and play football, baseball, and
   basketball. All of a sudden, there was a new priest there that had a
   Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. He loved coming to watch us,” Templeton
   said.

   A priest named Wayland Brown. The same Savannah priest who is now
   behind bars in South Carolina, serving 20 years for sexually assaulting
   children, but not before he met 13-year-old Templeton.

     “That’s how it all started. [Brown] would take me to the convenience
     store and buy us icees, candy, stuff like that, until it led into
     the abuse.”

   Abuse that spilled across the South Carolina state line, according to
   indictments.

     “I was raped in South Carolina so many times.”

   Templeton says he has only regained memory of the abuse in the past
   four years. In a civil lawsuit, he claims another Charleston priest was
   involved in the abuse with Brown, Father Raymond DuMouchel.

   “All I could think of was a guy, this Father Ray, Father Ray,”
   Templeton recalled. DuMonchel was the pastor at St. Anthony's Mission
   Church in Hardeeville, part of the Charleton Catholic Diocese.

     “I was raped numerous times between Ray DuMouchel and Wayland
     Brown," Templeton says. "Over 60 times."

   According to the Charleston Diocese, it became aware of inappropriate
   conduct by Father DuMouchel in November 2002, after he retired. The
   Diocese suspended him from the ministry.

   At one point, DuMouchel faced fondling charges. Prosecutors dropped
   them, and he died in 2006.

   “What makes Chris’ case unique [...] was the depth of the deceit with
   regard to Wayland Brown's abuse of children,” says Mark Tate,
   Templeton’s lawyer.

     “Can you ever make up for the loss of your youth? Can you ever make
     up for the loss of innocence? You can't do that. And we can't wave a
     magic wand and go back and make things better. But, we can try to
     win a verdict for him."

   The Diocese of Charleston filed its answer in the Templeton case on
   Monday morning, when it said it will continue to address this lawsuit
   in court.

     “We have offered Mr. Templeton professional counseling services and
     pastoral care through his (South Carolina) attorney, Mr. Gregg
     Meyers,” the diocese said in a statement.

   Raised in a large Catholic family in Savannah, Chris Templeton chose to
   stay in the city he loved. But Templeton believes there were more
   victims that have not come forward, who could no longer bear the
   reminder and moved away.

   Are there more Chris Templetons out there? He believes so:

     “There's a bunch, [who] probably want to die, but don’t know how to
     kill themselves. They don’t want to get out of bed everyday, or they
     are getting high, or they are in prison or getting drunk every day.
     They are sad, they are lonely, and they are shameful. Shame and
     guilt will destroy you, and there is a lot of that involved when you
     are raped as a child.”

   Templeton says he now wonders about the boys at his small parochial
   school. He says he knows of four or five boys within a grade or two who
   committed suicide. Too many, and he wants to know why.

   If anyone has information about other or similar crimes, they're asked
   to call the District Attorney's Office in Chatham County, Georgia at
   912-652-8080.
