Alan Pergament: '60 Minutes' report on sex abuse allegations in Buffalo
Diocese is powerful

   If Buffalo's Bishop Richard J. Malone thought silence is the way to
   treat the prestigious CBS news magazine “60 Minutes,” he was sadly
   mistaken.

   The “60 Minutes” story Sunday about the alleged sexual abuse by priests
   in the Buffalo Diocese over decades was as powerful as could be and
   even more.

   CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker did a great job, calmly doing the
   interviews with whistleblower Siobhan O’Connor, Deacon Paul Snyder III
   and the Rev. Robert Zilliox.

   And the three people being interviewed were exceptional detailing their
   stories, their motivation for coming forward and the outrage that
   resulted from the revelations.

   Their stories were so powerful they practically demanded answers from
   the Buffalo bishop.

   By declining to be interviewed for the program, the bishop looked weak.
   His written statement explaining why he didn’t participate also showed
   that he needs to better understand journalism or be better served by
   someone advising him who does know journalism.

   In his statement to “60 Minutes,” the bishop emphasized recent policies
   aimed at responding to the past problems weren't going to be addressed
   by the program.

   He added in part: “It is clear to me and my staff that your roster of
   interviews did not include those who are aware of the full extent of
   the efforts of our Diocese to combat child abuse. Nor does it include
   those who urge me every day to stay the course and restore the
   confidence of our faithful.”

   He continued: “Finally, although I have respectfully declined your
   invitation, I have sat for hours of interviews with highly-regarded
   local journalists – a newscaster and a reporter for our daily paper –
   so that our message can be distributed locally.”

   In other words, Malone wanted a more balanced story about what is going
   on now when "60 Minutes” understandably was more interested in
   reporting about the horrors of past practices than putting a positive
   face on what is being done now.

   In the eyes of “60 Minutes,” Malone declined to be the balance he was
   looking for.

   -sexual-abuse-allegations-but-did-nothing-60-minutes/

   His apparent view that sitting for hours with highly regarded local
   journalists was enough just didn’t cut it.

   While the “60 Minutes” piece included many of the details unveiled by
   WKBW-TV (Channel 7) reporter Charlie Specht and this newspaper, the TV
   program also included new information that could have and should have
   been addressed by the bishop.

   Malone should have been advised that facing an interview with a tough
   but fair national reporter could have gotten him more respect than the
   one he did last week with WIVB-TV (Channel 4) anchor Don Postles.

   That is especially true since after the eight-minute interview ended,
   Postles revealed that he is a member of the bishop’s Council of the
   Laity. That’s a journalistic conflict of interest even if Postles’
   heart was in the right place.

   I asked Channel 4 News Director Lisa Polster via a text when she became
   aware of Postles being on the committee. She hasn’t answered,
   suggesting she is aware the conflict looks bad even if Postles had
   looked tough.

   In the Channel 4 interview, Postles acted tough in his narration. His
   toughest moment came when he prefaced one of his questions this way:
   “As a father, I can’t imagine if any of my children were abused by a
   priest, the rage I could feel and the anger.”

   But overall, Postles acted tough while being much less than that. He
   didn’t follow up on some statements by the bishop that “60 Minutes”
   most likely would have addressed with him.

   That includes the bishop telling Postles that “with honesty and a
   totally clear conscience, Don, and to everyone else I have never, ever
   knowingly and intentionally left a priest in ministry that I knew had
   abused a child or moved him to another assignment or left them in the
   ministry ever.”

   Malone followed that by telling Postles that he tried to handle
   allegations against priests dealing with adults quietly “unless it was
   something really egregious.”

   I would have expected a “60 Minutes” reporter to ask the bishop to
   define “really egregious.” You would think all sexual abuse allegations
   are “really egregious.”

   The best way that Malone could have handled the difficult situation of
   being the focus of a “60 Minutes” report was to face a difficult
   cross-examination by Whitaker even if it meant some follow-up questions
   ignored by Postles.

   Of course, O’Connor, the pastor and the deacon would have been tough
   interviewees to follow because they all were so sincere and articulated
   their positions so well.

   A deeply religious former administrative assistant to the bishop,
   O’Connor’s piety and reasons for coming forward were admirable.

   O’Connor noted she was “most alarmed” at the handling of the Rev. Art
   Smith, who wasn't on the released list of 42 priests accused of sexual
   abuse allegations despite church records showing a complaint against
   him in 2013 by two young men and Smith being sent to counseling two
   years earlier “after repeated contact with an eighth-grade boy that
   included unwanted attention and Facebook messages.”

   “Our previous bishop had removed him from ministry, so I always thought
   it was odd that Bishop Malone had reinstated him when I explored his
   file more in depth, that might have really been the moment when I knew
   that I had to do something with this information,” O’Connor told
   Whitaker.

   In another chilling moment, O’Connor revealed that she was disturbed by
   the handling of the Rev. Fabian Maryanski, whose file included a 1980s
   accusation that he had sex with an underage girl. His absence from the
   list appeared to be a cover-up of a previous cover-up.

   When O’Connor read “we did not remove him from ministry despite full
   knowledge of the case, and so including him on list might require
   explanation,” she had a strong reaction.

   “And I remember thinking, if that’s their rationale for leaving a
   priest off, then how can I abide by this?” she told Whitaker.

   As impressive as O’Connor’s detailing of the alleged cover-up was, the
   most devastating sound bite came from Zilliox in an exchange with
   Whitaker after he told the reporter that several abuse allegations
   should have gone to Rome but didn’t.

   Whitaker: “How many of those priests should have been taken out of
   priesthood?”

   Zilliox: “I would argue at least eight or nine.”

   Whitaker: “How many of them still are in the priesthood here in
   Buffalo?”

   Zilliox: “All of them.”

   Whitaker: “All of them?”

   Zilliox: “All the guys that should have been removed from the
   priesthood are still priests.”

   Malone surely will be asked about that by local reporters this week –
   if he is willing to face them.
