Two more Western New York priests put on leave after abuse complaints

   The current pastor and the immediate former pastor of a large parish in
   Clarence both have been suspended from ministry after the Diocese of
   Buffalo received complaints of abuse against them.

   The suspended priests are Monsignor Frederick D. Leising and the Rev.
   Ronald P. Sajdak.

   Sajdak is the current pastor of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary
   Church in Clarence. Leising was pastor of the parish prior to Sajdak.

   Leising, 73, also is former president and rector of Christ the King
   Seminary in Aurora.

   In May, Bishop Richard J. Malone suspended a third priest linked to
   Nativity — the Rev. Fabian J. Maryanski, who was retired and assisted
   with Masses at the parish.

   Leising’s name surfaced earlier this week on the Buffalo Diocese’s
   Facebook page. A woman who had accused Maryanski of repeatedly sexually
   abusing her when she was a teenager in the 1980s commented on a diocese
   posting of a statement asking anyone with a claim of suspected abuse to
   contact the diocese.

   “Perhaps you should revisit my letter to Bishop Malone (April 2018) and
   address the situation with Fr. Fred Leising,” wrote Stephanie McIntyre
   in her Facebook comment.

   McIntyre’s letter to Malone primarily described years of allegedly
   being sexually abused by Maryanski. But she also mentioned in the
   letter an uninvited advance by Leising in 1988, in which the priest
   allegedly grabbed her, forcibly kissed her and stuck his tongue in her
   mouth. McIntyre said she was 19 at the time.

   “It was disgusting and considering I was already being abused by
   Maryanski, it was kind of the final straw in my trusting of priests.
   When I told Maryanski and he just defended Leising's actions as being
   the norm, I was destroyed,” McIntyre said in an interview Saturday with
   The Buffalo News.

   Leising, who was vice rector of Christ the King Seminary in 1988,
   denied making the advance. He said he remembers the incident with the
   woman because it was so unusual, but he has a different recollection of
   it than McIntyre.

   "She grabbed me and spun me around and she kissed me and I was very
   shocked by that," he said. "I would never have directly attempted to do
   anything like that to anyone against their will."

   The diocese first brought McIntyre's complaint to Leising's attention
   months ago, he said. But it wasn't until Saturday morning that
   Auxiliary Bishop Edward Grosz informed Leising that he was being put on
   administrative leave due to that complaint.

   Leising said he is disappointed in the bishop's decision. He is
   scheduled to meet with Grosz in person Monday, he said. Leising was the
   second former seminary rector to be put on leave due to an abuse
   complaint. The bishop in September suspended the Rev. Joseph C. Gatto,
   who had been head of the seminary since 2015.

   Sajdak, 63, did not immediately return a voicemail Saturday seeking
   comment.

   Sajdak was accused of abuse dating back to the 1970s, prior to his
   being a priest, in a claim submitted to the Buffalo Diocese’s program
   to compensate victims of abuse. Sajdak was ordained as a Buffalo
   Diocese priest in 1996. He spent five years in the late 1970s and early
   1980s with the Discalced Carmelite Community in Boston, Mass., and
   attended Wadhams Hall Seminary College in Ogdensburg before that.
