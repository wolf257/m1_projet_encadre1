   The state’s child welfare agency Friday agreed to stop sending children
   in its care to a North Side psychiatric hospital where children have
   reported being sexually abused and assaulted, but said it would not
   seek the full independent investigation advocates had requested,
   setting up a possible court fight.

   The decision by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services
   came one day after state lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties
   Union of Illinois demanded the agency allow an outside expert to
   conduct a comprehensive investigation of Aurora Chicago Lakeshore
   Hospital in Uptown.

   The ACLU, which monitors DCFS as part of a federal court consent
   decree, also called on the agency to immediately stop sending children
   in its care to the hospital when they need psychiatric treatment.

   Those demands followed a ProPublica Illinois investigation that found
   numerous allegations of sexual abuse and assault of children, as well
   as regulatory violations related to patients’ health and safety.

   “What they’ve offered is inadequate,” ACLU spokesman Ed Yohnka said.
   “They want to limit the investigation only to the complaints that have
   been made. That doesn’t tell you anything about the systemic problems
   at the facility.”

   DCFS has investigated 16 allegations of abuse or neglect involving
   children at the hospital since January, according to records obtained
   by ProPublica Illinois. The agency said it found sufficient evidence to
   support four of the allegations and continues to investigate five,
   including claims from 7-year-old and 12-year-old girls who reported
   they were sexually abused by the same employee. The remaining seven
   allegations were not substantiated.

   Some of the children who alleged abuse should have been released from
   the hospital. They had been cleared for discharge but remained there
   because DCFS could not find them a place to go, ProPublica Illinois
   found.

   DCFS said the agency was taking steps in response to the ACLU’s
   request, including placing a hold on all admissions of children in DCFS
   care to the hospital as of Friday, continuing daily unannounced visits
   at the hospital and submitting reports detailing which DCFS children
   have been discharged from the hospital and where they were placed.
   Finding placement for children who have been at the hospital beyond
   what is deemed medically necessary “remains a top priority,” DCFS wrote
   in its response to the ACLU.

   EDITORIAL: For sake of abused children, investigate North Side hospital

   The review, DCFS said in a statement, “will make sure nothing was
   missed in our investigation process and assess whether those cases
   reflect any pattern or practice requiring correction for the protection
   of children.”

   The sticking point for the ACLU, according to Yohnka, was that the
   review would be limited to the 16 child abuse and neglect
   investigations. The organization wanted a full, independent
   investigation of Lakeshore.

   Yohnka said DCFS has asked to select the expert who would conduct the
   review. “I don’t think that’s independent,” he said.

   The ACLU had threatened to take DCFS to court next week if the agency
   failed to respond satisfactorily. In light of what DCFS has offered,
   going to court remains on the table, said Yohnka.

   DCFS officials told the ACLU that if “concerns about systemic issues at
   the hospital” emerge during the agency’s review, they will work with
   the Illinois Department of Public Health, which is investigating the
   hospital on behalf of federal regulators.

   “That is unacceptable in our view. She should be leading on this, not
   following,” ACLU general counsel Heidi Dalenberg said of DCFS Acting
   Director Beverly “B.J.” Walker.

   Federal officials said Lakeshore has until the end of the month to
   correct deficiencies or they will cut off its federal funding; hospital
   officials say that a loss of funding could force the hospital to close.

   The hospital has said it works to provide a safe and therapeutic
   environment for its patients and would cooperate with any
   investigation. It was confident a review would find it operates at the
   “highest standards.”

   State Sen. Julie Morrison, a Democrat from Deerfield, sent a letter to
   Walker on Friday asking for a third-party investigation of Lakeshore
   and its practices.

   That review, she wrote, should include children who reported abuse and
   neglect at the hospital.

   Walker quickly responded to Morrison, writing “I assure you that we at
   DCFS take the safety and wellbeing of our state’s children seriously”
   and that the issue has her “urgent attention.”

   “I want to believe that the agency is taking this seriously but anyone
   who has followed DCFS knows this isn’t a new problem,” Morrison said in
   a statement. “So I’m hoping that this investigation and its results and
   changes are as prompt and direct as the response I received from the
   director.”

   Three Chicago lawmakers made a similar demand on Thursday. They
   requested that an independent reviewer should be appointed to “evaluate
   not only the cases at Chicago Lakeshore and the response by DCFS, but
   also to conduct a thorough review of quality of care and adherence to
   all relevant laws, policies, and procedures.”

   The reviewer, they wrote in the letter, should develop recommendations
   on how to “guarantee the safety and best possible outcomes” for
   children at the hospital now or in the future.

   Gov. Bruce Rauner, who appointed Walker last year, is monitoring the
   situation at Lakeshore and considering “additional options to ensure
   the children who receive care there are safe,” a Rauner spokeswoman
   said.

   DCFS’ acting inspector general, Meryl Paniak, who first urged DCFS to
   undertake the review, said the agency’s response was insufficient.

   “That’s not what I was asking for,” she said Friday. “That’s not an
   independent review. I don’t know what they’re going to accomplish by
   reviewing investigations that were done. That’s what you should be
   doing anyway.”

   Paniak said she wants to a see a complete review of Lakeshore by
   someone who has expertise in psychiatric hospitals and child welfare
   and will be able to evaluate systemic issues.

   Charles Golbert, Cook County’s acting public guardian, said he, too,
   wants to see a broader, more holistic review. That inquiry, he said,
   would examine a range of issues, including improper use of powerful
   psychotropic medication, lax supervision and the hospital’s repeated
   failures to make security camera video available.

   “I want one comprehensive independent investigation,” he said, not
   various agencies “focusing on a narrow piece of the problem in a
   vacuum.”
