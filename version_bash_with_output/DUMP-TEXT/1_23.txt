Report: Washington foster kids abused at out-of-state group home

   by
     * Allegra Abramo

   / October 17, 2018

   Because of a shortage of foster homes and group homes for children with
   behavioral and mental health challenges, Washington relies on
   out-of-state facilities like Clarinda Academy to house neglected and
   abused children removed from their parents. A new report from
   Disability Rights Washington claims that staff at the facility have
   been abusing some of those children. (Photo by Tina Pinedo/Disability

   Children entrusted to Washington’s foster-care system have endured
   “abusive” practices in a jail-like Iowa group home that inappropriately
   used painful physical restraints on children, according to a new
   report by a government-designated watchdog group.

   The report, released today by the nonprofit Disability Rights
   Washington, documents numerous instances in which youths between the
   ages of 14 and 16 were held down by three or more workers. One child’s
   glasses were broken when staffers pushed the youth to the floor, and
   another was restrained for 45 minutes.

   Washington social workers knew of the practices — some of which would
   not be allowed under Washington regulations — but failed to “ensure the
   rights and safety” of the teens, the report says. It focuses on the
   cases of three youths who were among about 20 Washington youths
   confined at the for-profit Clarinda Academy, which also houses juvenile
   delinquents, and a sister Iowa facility, Woodward Academy.

   “It hurt, I had bruises,” Kathie, 16, said of the restraint holds she
   says Clarinda staffers used on her a few times a week throughout her
   recent six-month stay at the facility. She spoke to InvestigateWest
   from a phone in her new group home in South Carolina and on the
   condition that this story use only her first name.

   The report points out that the state places young people in the custody
   of out-of-state group homes like Clarinda “without consent or due
   process,” circumventing protections against involuntary commitment.

   Youths’ case files obtained by Disability Rights show that Clarinda
   workers “use physical restraint for questionable reasons at best, and
   in some cases without justification,” the report says.

   Many of the youths in question would not have been sent out of state if
   not for Washington’s long-festering and desperate shortage of foster
   homes and group homes for youth with behavioral and mental health
   challenges. Washington increasingly relies on facilities spread across
   a dozen states to house neglected and abused children removed from
   their parents.

   Between 80 and 100 Washington children are now in out-of-state
   facilities. As those numbers have risen in recent years, attorneys and
   advocates for foster youth have sounded the alarm about the state’s
   ability to adequately monitor children in distant states, as
   InvestigateWest and Crosscut reported last month.

   The investigation released today by Disability Rights Washington, a
   group appointed under federal law to monitor the care of people with
   disabilities and mental illness, suggests those concerns are
   well-founded.

   In interviews with a dozen youths at Clarinda and Woodward in early
   2018, the organization heard consistent allegations of verbal and
   physical abuse. That prompted Disability Rights to launch an in-depth
   examination of three youths’ case files and internal Clarinda
   documents. Those records, it concludes, “demonstrate that Washington
   and Clarinda Academy are both failing to protect against the use of
   restraints for coercion and punishment for not following expectations.”

   Clarinda Academy management and a lawyer for the company did not
   respond to multiple phone calls and emails requesting comment.

   Washington sends dozens of foster youths to some of the other 29
   similar group homes owned by Clarinda’s parent company, Sequel Youth
   and Family Services. As of 2017, about three-quarters of Washington
   youth in out-of-state group homes were in Sequel facilities. The
   company also has plans to begin operating in Washington, according to
   Disability Rights.

   State officials said they took the report seriously and, based on a
   draft sent to the state in August, stopped sending kids to Clarinda and
   created plans for all children still there to find permanent homes or
   return to Washington by the end of next January. They have also
   dispatched state workers to check on all foster children in
   out-of-state facilities.

   For young people like Kathie with a history of childhood trauma, being
   physically restrained can cause further harm and worsening behavior,
   studies show. Yet treatment plans at Clarinda weren’t designed to
   effectively address youths’ traumatic history, according to Gauri Goel,
   a psychologist who interviewed the youths and reviewed their records as
   part of the Disability Rights inquiry. Instead, “the treatment they are
   receiving is likely to be ineffective and potentially
   counterproductive,” she wrote.

   A 2014 investigation of Clarinda by Disability Rights Iowa also found
   that the facility uses a “one-size-fits-all” approach to treatment and
   schooling, the Des Moines Register reported.

   Clarinda policy, as well as Iowa and Washington regulations, say youths
   should only be physically restrained when they present an imminent
   danger to themselves or others. But at Clarinda, residents who are
   being reprimanded are expected to stand completely still, and the
   report documents instances where the teens were restrained merely for
   moving an arm or hand.

   “Say that I was going to wipe my tears or cover my face because I’m
   crying,” Kathie told InvestigateWest. “Any sudden movements, I would
   end up getting restrained.”

   One teen was restrained for not obeying an order to stop scratching his
   legs, another for disrupting other residents in a dining area and
   refusing to leave.

   Youths showed Disability Rights how workers would “pull their elbows
   behind their backs and then force them to the ground by putting
   pressure on the backs of their knees,” the report says. Unlike
   Washington’s more stringent regulations around the use of restraints,
   Iowa’s do not prohibit pressure on joints, the chest or vital organs.

   Founded in 1992, Clarinda Academy was originally intended to be a
   facility for “delinquent” young men. Washington youth are sent there
   through the foster care system, not because they have committed a
   crime. (Photo by Tina Pinedo/Disability Rights Washington)

   Originally set up as a facility for “delinquent” young men, Clarinda
   Academy now houses up 266 young people ages 12 to 18. Its “typical
   student” is a juvenile offender, according to the parent company
   website.

   That helps explain why Clarinda is run “like a correctional
   institution,” according to Disability Rights, even though Washington
   youth are sent there through the foster care system, not because they
   have committed a crime. Clarinda sits across the street from a
   medium-security prison.

   The facility is tightly controlled. Boys and girls are strictly
   segregated, and in one case a youth was restrained for refusing to
   leave a hallway where children of the opposite gender were going to
   pass, the report says.

   The youths attend school on site, and they rarely leave. If they
   attempt to leave, staffers restrain them and bring them back.

   “For all practical purposes, they don’t have a choice to say, ‘I don’t
   think I need this level of treatment’ or ‘This program is not helping
   me.’ They don’t have that power,” said Disability Rights attorney Susan
   Kas, who made two trips to meet with youths at Clarinda.

   In Washington, young people age 13 and older have the right to leave an
   inpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment facility they
   entered voluntarily. State laws also protect them from continued
   involuntary treatment without a hearing.

   “Children in foster care do not lose these rights by virtue of having
   been removed from the care of their parents,” Lisa Kelly, a law
   professor at the University of Washington, wrote in an email. “They
   have the same rights as any other child in this state, and these rights
   are being ignored when they are essentially involuntarily committed to
   secure facilities that not only sit next to prisons but also possess
   many of the same restraints on their personal freedoms as prisons.”

   Beyond the potentially harmful treatment practiced at places like
   Clarinda, being cut off from family and other important adults in their
   lives is one of the most damaging consequences of out-of-state
   placements, advocates say.

   Isolation is a key danger. Phone calls home are limited to 10 to 20
   minutes per week.

   Washington provides financial help if family members want to visit
   foster youths sent out of state. But for children who are not connected
   to kin, the system rarely offers similar aid to family friends or
   others who might agree to take in the young person. Kathie said she
   didn’t receive a single in-person visit during her six months at
   Clarinda. As a result, connections with adults who might adopt or
   foster children upon their release tend to wither. “That was very
   devastating to the young people,” Kas said.

   To help kids get back into a family setting, rather than another
   institution, Kas said, it’s essential to support them in developing and
   maintaining those relationships.

   "There's a tendency to say, we don’t have enough group home beds here
   in Washington, so let’s get more group home beds, and then we can just
   shift everybody back to Washington,” Kas said. But discharging them to
   a family home, and hopefully a permanent one, “should be the goal of
   our system if we are going to do right by these kids.”

   Washington social workers also did not visit their charges in Clarinda,
   relying instead on reports from Iowa social workers. Even when they
   receive written reports from Iowa and Clarinda case workers about use
   of restraints, “Washington social workers do not follow up on
   allegations of abusive restraints,” Disability Rights found.

   / October 27

   The Department of Children, Youth and Families said in a statement that
   it will begin having case workers call out-of-state youths monthly and
   visit them quarterly.

   The department wrote that it “agrees with Disability Rights
   Washington’s main premise that children in out-of-home care are in
   general better off as close to home as possible, and that we should
   place all children in in-state facilities where possible.” However, it
   continued, “DCYF can’t cavalierly 'bring them home' without a plan to
   address each child’s individual needs and a placement option that is
   better than the placement they are in today.”

   Department secretary Ross Hunter called in his recent budget proposal
   for bringing all out-of-state Washington foster youth back within two
   years. Part of his plan involves shoring up capacity in Washington
   group homes, which have cut beds in recent years due in part to low
   reimbursement rates from the state.

   The department did not respond to a query from InvestigateWest about
   how much it pays Clarinda, but similar facilities in Washington are
   eligible to receive more than $12,000 per month. Sequel’s projected
   2017 revenue for all of its residential treatment centers was $161
   million, or more than $69,000 per bed, according to an investor
   presentation. A private equity firm acquired a majority stake in Sequel
   last year, citing “tremendous continued growth opportunities.”

   Over the past few months, the state has removed the three youths who
   were the focus of the Disability Rights Washington report from
   Clarinda, Kas said, but two remain in other group homes.

   Kathie, who has been in foster care since age 13, said her new group
   home is “just as terrible” as Clarinda, and that staffers there still
   physically restrain her.

   Yet, Kathie said, she’s doing better. She hasn’t harmed herself in
   almost two months. She dreams of returning to live with her best friend
   in Washington and to her school choir. She says she hopes to someday
   sing on America’s Got Talent.

   In the meantime, she would like the state will give kids like her
   another chance and bring them home. Keeping them out of state is
   “making us kids more and more stressed,” she said. “It doesn’t help
   anything at all.”
