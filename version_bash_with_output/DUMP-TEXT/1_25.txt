   Irish bishop: Abuse and cover-up will not be tolerated in Church

   Ossory.)

It took “far too long” for the Church to understand that both sexual abuse
and its cover-up “will no longer be tolerated,” according to the bishop
opening the annual conference of the National Board for Safeguarding Children
in the Catholic Church in Ireland.

   LEICESTER, United Kingdom – It took “far too long” for the Church to
   understand that both sexual abuse and its cover-up “will no longer be
   tolerated,” according to the bishop opening the annual conference of
   the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in
   Ireland.

   Bishop Dermot Farrell of Ossory said Oct. 26 that many people have felt
   “anger and dismay” after recent revelations about sexual abuse in the
   Catholic Church across the globe.

   Just before Pope Francis visited Ireland for the World Meeting of
   Families in August, the Church in the United States was hit with the
   double blow of the exposure of the years of sexual misconduct of former
   Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and the shocking details in a Pennsylvania
   grand jury report into clerical sexual abuse in six dioceses in that
   state. Since then, further reports were published in several European
   countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.

   “Despite the many reports and serious findings in this area here in
   Ireland in recent years, these reports from overseas were nonetheless
   dreadful. They have negatively affected many, many people, in
   particular victims and survivors of abuse, families and the community
   of faithful,” Farrell said.

   “It is still right, however, that the truth of these crimes would come
   to light, so that the abuse itself can be addressed and ultimately
   healed by a genuine response that is willing to go even deeper than the
   childhood terror inflicted on so many children,” the bishop continued.

   The National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in
   Ireland was founded in 2006, and has issued reports on sexual abuse in
   every diocese in Ireland as well as the country’s religious orders.

   The Oct. 26-27 conference in Kilkenny is its third national meeting,
   and has the theme ‘Be Not Afraid.’

   Farrell praised the “exemplary safeguarding standards and the clear
   mechanisms” of the board, saying they have allowed the Church to
   “respond vigorously” to sexual abuse complaints.

   “I want … to acknowledge the National Board’s contribution to
   addressing the grave issues, serious wrongs and tragic failures over
   the previous decades that have come to light in our land in and in our
   Church, as the scale and depth of the sexual abuse crisis in Ireland
   has been revealed,” Farrell said.

   “This terrible scandal has undermined the lives of many children and
   vulnerable people — young and not so young; it has eroded trust and
   good will and hangs like a cloud over all who seek to witness to the
   Good News,” he said.

   The bishop also praised the courage of abuse survivors, “who first
   brought the horrific truth of sexual abuse to light (and) must continue
   to be matched by our courage to listen to the survivors and, to respond
   in truth and in justice to all of them.”

   Farrell said the Catholic Church in Ireland “has been dismayed because
   of the devastating harm that has been done to children and for the way
   the leaders failed, for whatever reason, to respond, or responded very
   poorly, when in many instances there were grave indications that
   children had been abused.”

   He said if such reports had been acted upon in a timely manner, rather
   than denying or covering up the abuse and silencing victims to prevent
   scandal, it would have prevented others from being sexually abused.

   “We are now going through a period of rightful indignation, and
   necessary purification. It took far too long to arrive at a position
   where both sexual abuse of the most innocent in our communities and its
   cover-up in the Church will no longer be tolerated,” said the bishop.
