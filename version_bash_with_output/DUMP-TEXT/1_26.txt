   JOHANNESBURG - Anti-abuse groups in support of the Parktown Boys who
   were sexually abused by convicted offender Collan Rex say greater work
   needs to be done at schools to prevent such crimes.

   Earlier this week, the case against the former water polo assistant
   coach from Parktown Boys High School was postponed to later this month.

   Rex has been convicted of 144 counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of
   common assault.

   Several parents and anti-abuse groups say there isn't enough education
   on body safety in schools and how children should report sexual abuse
   crimes.

   Koleinu South Africa's director Rozanne Sack says in most cases
   children aren't given the opportunity to speak up.

   “There needs to be more education on reporting protocol with child
   abuse cases.”

   She says she hopes justice will prevail in this case.

   “We are proud of the boys and we are here for them.”

   Sentencing has been scheduled for 27 November.
