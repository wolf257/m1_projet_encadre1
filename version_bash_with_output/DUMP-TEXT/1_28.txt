Accusations Of Abuse And Neglect of Don Meredith’s Daughter At Center Of
Court Battle

     * Bridgett Howard
     * 4:55 pm
     * November 2, 2018

   (LEX 18/ Courier Journal)–Late football legend Don Meredith wanted his
   mentally challenged daughter to stay in the care of the Stewart Home in
   Frankfort, but some relatives have claimed that her stepmother
   underfunded the daughter’s trust, which led to a court battle over
   allegations of abuse and neglect.

   Heather Meredith, 49, is the football star’s youngest child. She has
   lived at the Stewart Home for years and it is where her father wanted
   her to stay. He set up a trust to cover the necessary expenses, but
   when Don Meredith died in 2010, Heather’s stepmother took over
   guardianship and control of her trust.

   In hundreds of documents, collected during an investigation by the
   Franklin County Sheriff’s Department, it is alleged, by Heather’s
   biological mother, that social workers stated Heather was abused and
   neglected by not having enough money in her trust to cover the
   necessary expenses. It also states that Heather’s biological mother
   believes Heather’s welfare suffered because of her stepmother, who
   controlled the trust. A state social worker reported that Heather’s
   teeth were not fixed for seven years and she went on to write that her
   guardian “failed to protect her financial interest and medical issues.”

   The allegations were later unsubstantiated.

   “The bottom line for me was always that I was concerned whether or not
   the trust was properly funded and this girl’s, woman’s needs were met,”
   said Franklin County Commonwealth’s Attorney Larry Cleveland. “Those
   photos, that information was troubling.”

   Cleveland was asked to prosecute the case, but says that it was
   ultimately settled. Heather’s biological mother took over guardianship
   and her stepmother put more money into the trust so Heather’s needs are
   funded for a lifetime.

   The allegations of abuse and neglect were never handled criminally.

   “I thought that if I took my case to a grand jury, I’d probably get an
   indictment, let’s put it that way,” said Cleveland.

   A family spokesperson for Heather Meredith’s biological family sent LEX
   18 a statement, “While we are disappointed that such a private and
   sensitive family matter has been made public, we take comfort knowing
   that Heather, the most important party in this situation, is now safe
   and happy.”
