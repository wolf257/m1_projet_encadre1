 ‘You try to forget’: Man remembers alleged abuse at St. Joseph’s Oratory

   Pierre-Yves Asselin joined the children’s choir when he was 8 years
   old. The abuse, he says, started early and lasted years.

   Warning: This story contains explicit content.

   A week before the Supreme Court of Canada is set to hear arguments over
   whether Montreal’s St. Joseph’s Oratory should be included in a sexual
   assault class action suit, one alleged victim is speaking out for the
   first time about the abuse he remembers suffering at the iconic
   institution.

   Pierre-Yves Asselin, now 68, says he was repeatedly sexually abused —
   between the ages of 8 and 17 — at the hands of oratory staff and
   members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.

   “It’s the kind of thing you try to forget. That you try to not think
   about,” Asselin said from his Verdun apartment Wednesday. “But it
   always comes back to you.”

   Asselin has never spoken to anyone about the abuse he suffered,
   including his family. He says he first thought of opening up about it
   after hearing of the congregation’s settlement with victims in 2013,
   but hesitated to do so.

   Hearing more and more about Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals — and
   the more recent movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault —
   convinced him he needed to speak out.

   From a young age, Asselin knew he wanted to be a musician. His father
   played the cello and violin professionally and was the music director
   at several chapels around Montreal. So joining the St. Joseph’s Oratory
   children’s choir when he was 8 seemed like a perfect fit.

   But the abuse, Asselin says, started early and lasted years. The
   memories have always gnawed at him. Some are vague, others vivid.

   He says the first incidents came when he was 8 or 9, while showering at
   the oratory’s on-site dormitory for children. Two female instructors
   would often enter the shower and insist on scrubbing him down. He knew
   it wasn’t right, he says, but was more confused than anything.

   Then, a bit later, he remembers being brought down to the basement of
   what was called Manoir One on the oratory’s grounds, where he says a
   Holy Cross brother sexually abused him for the first time.

   He recalls the feeling of the man’s rough beard against his face, him
   forcing his tongue into his mouth, and feeling the brother’s erect
   penis against his stomach as he pushed against him.

   “That happened two or three times,” Asselin said, “and then one day he
   disappeared.”

   At 11 or 12, Asselin says, a Holy Cross father called him into an
   upstairs parlour at an on-site residence. The father acted as a sort of
   guidance counsellor to the children, Asselin said, and they were
   encouraged to confess to him. But once alone in the room with him,
   Asselin was asked to take his pants off so the father could inspect
   him, he says.

   “He said, ‘Maybe we need to make sure you’re in good health and
   everything is OK.’”

   But to Asselin, who aspired to play the organ from the moment the
   oratory installed its Grand Beckerath Organ in 1960, some of the worst
   kinds of abuse came from a man he admired the most: the lead organist
   at the oratory, who took him under his wing as a student.

   Sitting on the bench with their backs to the organ, Asselin says, the
   organist would often rub his thighs or take Asselin’s hand and place it
   on his own thighs.

   The abuse, he says, continued in different forms for years.

   “I didn’t want to stop him, because I didn’t want to lose access to the
   organ. That’s what I feared,” he said. “It always happened at the
   oratory, or at his house, and he was an employee of the oratory.”

   While spending the night at the man’s house when he was 17, Asselin
   says the man forced himself on him and tried to get him into bed.
   Asselin refused, and it was the last time the man tried to abuse him.

   Asselin would go on to enjoy a successful organist career of his own,
   working internationally from 1975 to 1995, but he says the abuse never
   left him. He’s often wondered if he was the only one to suffer what he
   remembers going through or if he was simply too young to realize it was
   happening to others around him.

   He’s also thought about trying to forget it all, to somehow repress the
   memories and move on. But he hopes sharing his story instead could help
   others.

   “Will it change anything? I don’t know,” he said. “But there are more
   chances of making a difference by speaking out than by not.”

   According to Sébastien Richard, an abuse survivor and spokesperson for
   church abuse victims in Quebec, Asselin’s experience — and his decision
   to speak about it so many years later — is typical for many victims.

   “Like it or not, it always stays with you. You can’t act like it didn’t
   happen,” he said. “You can put it away, put it to the side, but
   inevitably there’s an event that will happen that will make it come
   back up.”

   In 2013, the Congregation of Holy Cross apologized and paid up to $18
   million to compensate 206 victims for abuse that occurred at three
   Quebec institutions. The class action suit did not include St. Joseph’s
   Oratory.

   A second class action, which named the oratory along with other Holy
   Cross institutions, was launched when roughly 40 more alleged victims
   came forward after hearing other men share their stories through the
   lawsuit. The oratory was included in the suit amid allegations that
   some of the abuse occurred there.

   The suit was first rejected by Quebec Superior Court in 2015, but then
   allowed to move forward by the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Supreme
   Court of Canada accepted to hear the oratory’s appeal earlier this
   year.

   To Richard, who will be travelling to Ottawa for next Wednesday’s
   hearings, the case, among other things, is “a question of access to
   justice.”

   He said the average age of those wanting to participate in the suit is
   80. In some cases, he added, their health is failing and time is
   running out.

   “We’re talking about people who’ve lived with this for a very, very
   long time,” he said.
