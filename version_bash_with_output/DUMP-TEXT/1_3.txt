Health Council gets look at Partnership abuse program

   Posted Saturday, November 3, 2018 10:16 pm
   By COLBY DENTON

   "Partnership," and how this program promotes success, became the recent
   focus of the Bradley County Health Council.

   The guest speaker during the organization's recent gathering was
   RaShina Viverette, who spoke of how the program works within a
   four-county region of Southeast Tennessee, including Bradley.

   Partnership has over 20 programs that provide individuals and families
   with the tools and resources to build stability and create
   independence. These programs impact the entire circle of ages, from
   young to elderly, but are not meant to help an individual for a day,
   month or even a year. Instead, the programs aim to help people develop
   a lifetime of success and the skills needed to do just that.

   â€œWe work with five different centers of service, including youth
   services, family strengthening services, crisis services, deaf services
   and elder services,â€� Viverette stated.

   Viverette works with Bradley, McMinn, Polk and Meigs counties and helps
   people get through the organizationâ€™s Family First Program to help
   them become self-sufficient in a short time frame.

   For victims of abuse, Partnership offers housing in safe environments
   as well as court advocates who work with the victims to grant them
   orders of protection from their abusers. Accompanying this is its rape
   crisis center, which provides medical treatment, forensic exams,
   counseling and legal advocacy for victims of sexual assault.

   One big identifier of abuse can be if a person in your life is
   constantly talking down to you. In many abuse situations, the abused
   will not want to acknowledge theyâ€™ve been in these situations because
   they havenâ€™t been physically hit; however, abusers can control their
   victims through a number of methods like not letting them have a job,
   keeping them at home at all times or only allowing their victims to
   work at a particular location.

   â€œThe people who abuse others create a sense of fear in their
   victims,â€� Viverette said. â€œOn average, 20 people experience
   domestic violence every minute. This affects 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9
   men. We often focus only on services for females and forget about the
   fact that men can be abused too.â€�

   Unfortunately, Viverette said that the statistics may be
   under-representing the actual abuse taking place overall, as many of
   those abused â€” especially men â€” are unwilling or embarrassed to
   come forward to authorities about the abuse. Over 19 million women and
   5 million men have been stalked as well, and Viverette stated that when
   they hear a stalking case, they try to get a sense of the severity of
   the situation and immediately protect the victim with an order of
   protection. Many times, the stalker is a person who the victim has
   known in the past, such as a significant other.

   Independence for seniors is also paramount, as Partnershipâ€™s
   homemakers assist the elderly with daily tasks such as housekeeping,
   grocery shopping and accompaniment to the doctor. The company also
   offers healing to elder and disabled victims of abuse and financial
   exploitation.

   Following Viveretteâ€™s presentation, health educator Amy Davenport
   explained how on Dec. 5, the health department is providing free flu
   vaccines from 4-7 p.m at the Cleveland Family YMCA. For more
   information, contact the Bradley County Health Department. After
   several other individual updates, the meeting was concluded.

   The Bradley County Health Council will meet again on Nov. 20, at
   Peerless Road Church.Â
