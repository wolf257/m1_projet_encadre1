   Ugandan scholar and activist Stella Nyanzi has been arrested following
   allegations she abused President Yoweri Museveni and his deceased
   mother.

   Controversial Ugandan scholar and activist Stella Nyanzi has been
   arrested.

   According to the Daily Monitor, detectives from the Directorate of
   Criminal Investigations headquarters pounced on Ms Nyanzi following
   allegations she abused President Yoweri Museveni and his deceased
   mother.

   Nyanzi was arrested at a time she was holding a silent strike at
   Makerere University in Kampala.

   She opted for the strike after the institution’s management failed to
   restore her office space despite a court ruling.

   “We have her and detectives are yet to interrogate her,” said DCI
   Spokesperson Vincent Ssekatte.

   It is alleged that Nyanzi abused President Museveni and his deceased
   mother on September 16 on her Facebook page, with Ssekatte describing
   the offence as cyber harassment and offensive communication.

   If found guilty, Nyanzi could face a fine of upto UGS480,000 (about
   Ksh12,000) or a year in jail, or both.

   This is the second time police are arresting Nyanzi on allegations of
   abusing President Museveni and his family.

   In April 2017, Nyanzi was picked from Mackinon Suites Hotel in Kampala
   where she was speaking to Rotarians about fundraising money for
   sanitary pads for school girls, and charged with two counts including
   cyber harassment and offensive communication. She is still battling the
   charges.
