Air Force examining whether crew abused by VIPs on boozy military flight should

   flight should get formal apology

   The Canadian Air Force is examining whether the drunk VIPs who harassed
   a military flight crew last year on a morale tour should apologize,
   according to documents obtained by Postmedia.

   Some of the VIPs on the taxpayer-funded Canadian Forces tour were
   abusive but the military flight crew trying to deal with them felt they
   had no choice but endure the behaviour as the individuals were guests
   of Canada’s top soldier, Gen. Jon Vance, a recently released military
   investigation found.

   The civilian passengers were exempt from security screening because
   they were VIPs and some — already drunk — walked on to the Canadian
   Forces aircraft with alcoholic drinks in their hands.

   The December 2017 VIP trip to Greece and Latvia, which cost taxpayers
   $337,000, resulted in a sex assault charge earlier this year against
   former NHL player Dave “Tiger” Williams and a public relations black
   eye for the Forces.

   The trip, planned by Vance’s office, has been dubbed the “party” flight
   by some military personnel because of what unfolded on the RCAF Polaris
   aircraft. Video from the flight shows people with their drinks —
   including one of Vance’s staff — dancing in the aisles of the aircraft
   as a rock band plays at the back of the plane. Others chewed tobacco,
   in violation of Canadian Forces rules, spitting the slimy juice into
   cups, according to the investigation. There were allegations two
   individuals were so drunk they urinated themselves.

     * Photos suggest partying on past military VIP junkets not a one-time

   Air Force brass had a good idea of some of what happened just days
   after the flight and on Dec. 12, 2017 launched a crackdown on how
   alcohol was to be served on such VIP excursions, the newly released
   records obtained by Postmedia indicate. Then RCAF commander Lt.-Gen.
   Michael Hood ordered the commander of 1 Canadian Air Division to not
   only further investigate the allegations but examine “whether an
   acceptable form of restitution was possible to include a formal
   apology, if warranted and acceptable to those involved.”

   The Canadian Forces did not provide comment on whether the crew will
   receive an apology.

   But the behaviour of some VIPs was so out of control that a February
   2018 RCAF investigation concluded the safety of the flight was
   compromised.  “The state of some of the passengers could have
   compromised the safety of the crew and other passengers in an emergency
   situation,” noted Col. Mark Goulden, commander of 8 Wing.

   The Canadian Forces has not provided information on the VIPs on the
   aircraft or which ones were inebriated.

   Initial details of the “alleged sexual harassment and touching” on the
   aircraft were transmitted to dozens of RCAF senior staff on Dec. 6,
   2017. There was concern within the Forces that the news media might
   find out about what happened, according to the documents obtained under
   the Access to Information law.

   player Dave âTigerâ Williams, left, is seen on a 2010 military
   morale tour to Afghanistan with what appear to be beads stuck up his
   nose. thecarpetfrogs.com

   Military police charged Williams on Feb. 7 with sexual assault as well
   as assault but few details were released about the events on the plane.
   The alleged victim is a female military flight attendant. Williams has
   denied any wrongdoing.

   Vance indicated on Dec. 6 that he knew about the role excessive alcohol
   played on the flight, the documents noted.

   On Feb. 13, 2018, Chris Henderson, the Defence Department’s assistant
   deputy minister of public affairs, updated Vance and Deputy Minister
   Jody Thomas about the answers he was going to supply Postmedia,
   according to the documents. Those included the claim that “on this
   particular flight, like on commercial flights, alcohol was permitted
   and served to Team Canada guests.”

   But Henderson’s claim flies in the face of what was already known by
   the military leadership as well as the Air Force investigation. Besides
   boarding the aircraft drunk, with open alcoholic beverages, the VIPs
   had a cooler full of booze set up on the plane, where they were able to
   serve themselves. The alcohol was authorized by Vance and paid for by
   his staff.

   In addition, in the statement provided to Postmedia, Henderson also
   claimed that the “average cost of such a visit is $15,000.”

   Postmedia later compiled figures showing the flight cost taxpayers more
   than $337,000.
