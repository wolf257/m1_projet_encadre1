   Daniel Stip, 22, pictured, dragged the pensioner into her home in
   Paignton, Devon and raped her before stealing her late husband's ashes,
   just days after trying to attack a 25-year-old woman who managed to
   fight him off

   A man who raped a pensioner he grabbed while she was putting her bins
   out before laughing and running off with her husband's ashes has been
   detained in hospital.

   Daniel Stip, 22, dragged the pensioner into her home in Paignton, Devon
   as she put her bins out on to the street ready for collection in
   January this year, a court heard.

   After raping her he laughed and stole a precious piece of jewellery
   containing her late husband's ashes, it was said.

   Just three days earlier he grabbed and attempted to rape a 25-year-old
   but she had fought him off, the court heard.

   At that time he was wanted by police in connection with another
   attempted rape of a Cambridge University student in September 2017.

   After his arrest Stip told police: 'I've killed, I've raped, I've
   stolen, everything.'

   Stip, a paranoid schizophrenic originally from South Africa, was given
   a hospital order by a judge at Exeter Crown Court who described him as
   a danger to the public.

   He said: 'It's clear on any view you're presently dangerous and present
   a significant risk of causing further sexual offences against women.

   'You conducted these actions against women who were strangers and while
   you were suffering from a serious mental disorder.'

   DNA evidence identified the 22-year-old and he was later arrested in
   Bristol.

   While under section in hospital he phoned police to confess his crimes.

   He told police: 'I've killed, I've raped, I've stolen, everything.

   'I only raped that lady so I could be an angel to the victims.

   'If I raped her then by karma I have to be the one that gets raped
   tenfold.'

   Stipp, appearing by video link at Exeter Crown Court, pictured, was
   handed an indefinite hospital order after he pleaded guilty to rape,
   two attempted rapes, burglary and robbery

   The defendant appeared via video link for sentence at Exeter Crown
   Court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to rape, two attempted rapes,
   burglary and robbery.

   Stip was sentenced under Section 37 order of the Mental Health Act 1983
   and given an indefinite hospital order.

   Devon and Cornwall police detective sergeant Simon Lee, from the Sexual
   Offences and Domestic Abuse investigation Team, said: 'I welcome the
   sentencing of Daniel Stip today following a lengthy and complex
   investigation by South Devon Detectives.

   'He targeted lone women in attempts to fulfil his sexual desires and
   caused them to fear for their lives through violent and violating
   attacks.

   '[The] sentence reflects justice for his victims and the need for
   appropriate treatment to ensure he cannot prey on others.'
