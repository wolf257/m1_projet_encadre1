10-year-old girl raped by uncle in Shakarpur

   Monday, 05 November 2018 | Staff Reporter | NEW DELHI

   In a horrific incident, a 10-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her
   uncle in Shakarpur area of the National Capital on Sunday.

   According to a senior police official, the girl had gone to her aunt’s
   house, which was across the road from her place, where her 32-year-old
   uncle allegedly raped her.

   “The girl narrated her ordeal to her parents, following which the
   parents approached to the police,” said the senior police official.

   “We have registered a case and are waiting for the medical examination
   report.

   “The man is absconding and we are trying to trace him,” said the police
   official.

   According to sources, the girl had come to Delhi with her parents a few
   days ago.

   The girl hails from West Bengal. The parents of the victim work as
   labourers in the city.

   The accused is also a native of West Bengal and is married to the
   victim’s father’s sister,” said the source.

   Earlier on November 1, a 30-year-old cab driver was arrested for
   allegedly raping a minor girl, whom he had been dropping to school for
   the past two-three months.

   The incident was reported from east Delhi’s Madhu Vihar and the
   accused, a neighbour of the victim, was hired by her parents to drop
   her to school.
