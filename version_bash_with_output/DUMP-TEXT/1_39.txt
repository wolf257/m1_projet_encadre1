   A woman who said she was sexually assaulted by another passenger
   onboard an overnight American Airlines flight last year has sued the
   carrier in federal court.

   The complaint, filed Wednesday by Colorado resident Aubrey Lane,
   alleges American failed in its duty to protect her and other passengers
   by allowing a visibly drunk man to board a June 16, 2017 redeye flight
   from  Phoenix to New York, and continuing to serve him as many as six
   alcoholic drinks.

   The man, whose identity hasn’t been publicly disclosed, was seated next
   to Lane and harassed her throughout the flight, according to Lane and
   another passenger seated nearby. At some point during the flight, the
   man followed Lane to the plane’s bathroom where he sexually assaulted
   her, the lawsuit said.

   “Knowing the clear dangers of intoxication and the sexual assault
   threats, especially on red eye flights, American offered no protection
   to Aubrey Lane...despite the verbal warnings of Passenger 12C and the
   obvious obnoxious, aggressive, threatening and intoxicated behavior of
   Passenger 12B,” the complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court in New
   York, said.

   American Airlines’ spokesman Michelle Mohr said the company has yet to
   receive the lawsuit and will review the complaint once it does.

   “We are deeply troubled by any allegation of misconduct onboard
   our aircraft or at any of our facilities,” Mohr said.  "If our crews
   discover or are told about any alleged illegal misconduct that may
   occur on the aircraft, law enforcement is contacted and will meet the
   aircraft upon arrival...It is up to law enforcement to determine what,
   if any criminal activity, took place.”

   Airport police met with Lane at the gate after the plane landed, but
   her assailant was not apprehended at the time. Lane’s case was turned
   over to the FBI, which typically handles investigations of crimes that
   occur on aircraft, but the agency has declined to comment and no
   arrests have been made.
   She said she was raped on a flight. American Airlines called it a
   'nuisance claim.' Now, she's speaking out

   When Lane first approached the carrier about the incident last year, an
   American employee described it as a “nuisance claim” and offered $5,000
   as a settlement.

   The carrier later apologized for how it responded to Lane’s claim and
   said it has since put new procedures in place for following-up on
   reports of onboard disturbances, including sexual misconduct.

Lack of awareness

   Lane’s case is one of several that have called increasing attention to
   the issue of sexual assault and harassment aboard aircraft in the past
   year.

   Washington resident Allison Dvaladze sued Delta Air Lines earlier this
   year over its handling of a 2016 incident where a stranger sitting next
   to Dvaladze grabbed her crotch while she was falling asleep on an
   overnight flight to Europe.

   Last November, Randi Zuckerberg,  a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and
   sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, tweeted about explicit
   sexual comments made by a man sitting next to her on an Alaska Airlines
   flight, generating national headlines.

   Earlier this month, a Denton man was arrested after he allegedly
   harassed and touched a woman on a Los Angeles to Dallas Southwest
   flight.

   The Association of Flight Attendants has campaigned for greater
   awareness and training of flight crews to respond to in-flight sexual
   assault, a problem the group’s president has called a “silent
   epidemic.”
   [scaletowidth#tl-1030275933816225794;1043138249']

   A 2017 survey of nearly 2,000 flight attendants conducted by the union
   found that 1 in 5 had received reports of in-flight sexual assault or
   harassment during their careers. Most said they had no knowledge of
   written guidance or training on how to handle such reports, according
   to the union.

   The FBI, which typically investigates crime onboard aircraft, has also
   seen a rise in the number of sexual assaults reported on planes, from
   38 in 2014 up to 63 in the 12-months ending Sept. 30, 2017. The agency
   said many incidents go unreported.

   The awareness effort has made some progress, with a federal aviation
   bill passed earlier this month calling for the establishment of an
   industry task force to study and make recommendations to improve flight
   crew training and reporting of sexual misconduct on planes.

   emergency landing, Denton man's arrest

   Executives at Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have also spoken out
   on the issue in the last year, with Alaska Airlines adding new training
   for flight attendants aimed at preventing and addressing sexual
   harassment or assault.

The alcohol factor

   Lane’s case combines two elements experts say are frequently present in
   onboard sexual assaults -- alcohol and overnight flights.

   In an email to American Airlines executives sent a week after the
   incident, a woman sitting in the same row as Aubrey, identified only as
   Passenger 12C in the lawsuit, describes the man Lane said assaulted her
   as “stumbling” onto the plane.

   “He fumbled in the aisle, struggling to find his seat, and once seated,
   he immediately confessed that he had been drinking for hours, that we
   was very nervous to fly and that he needed a drink,” said the email,
   which was addressed to American’s CEO Doug Parker, senior vice
   president of customer experience Kerry Philipovitch and another
   customer relations manager. “This man was not fit to fly, but yet
   American Airlines allowed him to fly.”

   The woman said she watched as the man was served two vodkas, a beer and
   a soda, an order he repeated later in the flight. He began acting
   increasingly erratic, the woman said in the email, telling Lane he was
   “in love with her” and attempting to touch and kiss Lane over her
   objections.
   Flight attendants say they regularly face groping, lewd comments from
   passengers

   The woman said she alerted flight attendants twice that the man was
   making other passengers uncomfortable and it wasn’t until a third
   complaint, after the man had spilled his beer, that she and Lane were
   moved to different seats.

   Although she did not witness the assault, the woman said Lane’s
   demeanor changed about two hours in after returning from the bathroom,
   a period of time when the man was also away from his seat.

   The woman said she waited for Lane in the gate area after the plane
   landed, where Lane told her she had been sexually assaulted in the
   bathroom.

   “You may ask, and certainly the police did, ‘Why didn’t she report it
   to a flight attendant? In a nutshell, she was in shock,” the email to
   American executives read. “The flight crew had not stepped in prior to
   this, so I don’t blame her for not placing a lot of trust in their
   action to respond.”

Protecting passengers

   Lane’s lawsuit alleges American Airlines failed to follow its own
   safety policies as well as federal regulations that bar airlines from
   allowing passengers who “appear to be intoxicated” to board an
   aircraft. Federal guidelines also prohibit continuing to serve
   alcoholic drinks to passengers who appear to be intoxicated.

   The suit argues that American was negligent and breached the duty of
   care it owes passengers to ensure their safe travel by allowing Lane’s
   assailant to board the plane and continuing to serve him drinks,
   despite warnings about his behavior from a passenger.

   Lane’s attorneys said communication with American has been
   “non-existent” since earlier this year. While the FBI investigation is
   still active to the best of their knowledge, Lane’s attorneys said they
   couldn’t wait any longer to take action against the carrier.

   “The bottom line is, American Airlines’ number one priority is supposed
   to be passenger safety,” said attorney Meg Foley. “They failed
   miserably here.”
