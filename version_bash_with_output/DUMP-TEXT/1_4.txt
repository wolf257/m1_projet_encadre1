   The Child Protection and Family Services Agency (CPFSA) has reported a
   20 per cent increase in the number of abuse cases being reported to its
   investigators, with some blood-curdling cases on the list.

   These include a case where a three-year-old boy was beaten to death,
   allegedly by a step-parent.

   Another three-year-old boy was burnt with a pot of hot soup thrown on
   him by his mother, while a three-year-old girl suffered a broken
   shoulder from an abusive mother.

   In one case, a six-year-old girl was being beaten and left on the
   roadside at night while another six-year-old girl was stabbed in the
   neck by her mother for spilling soap powder.

   These are included in the almost 13,000 cases reported to the CPFSA
   between January and September this year. This is only 820 short of the
   total number of cases reported to the agency for all of 2017.


230 PREGNANT AFTER ABUSE


   According to CPFSA investigators, at least 1,193 of the reports
   received this year were for incidents of sexual abuse, with at least 12
   of the children sexually abused allegedly by persons employed to care
   for them.

   More than 230 of the children sexually abused were left pregnant.

   "Since the start of the year, our investigations team has dealt with a
   total of 2,327 cases of sexual abuse, with Kingston and St Andrew
   recording 463 of these cases," CEO of the CPFSA Rosalee Gage-Grey told
   The Gleaner as she described the numbers as disheartening.

   "As it relates to physical abuse matters, we note that Kingston and St
   Andrew remain the dominant parishes with a total of 425, while St Ann
   recorded the second highest, with 263.

   "With regard to negligence, Kingston and St Andrew recorded 377,
   Manchester recorded 320, while Westmoreland recorded 266," added​
   Gage-Grey.

   She said that the CPFSA would soon roll out an
   '#everychilddeservesprotection' campaign to combat the rising number of
   incidents on the island.

   "It is very disheartening to see how our children are treated. We are
   coming from the standpoint that there are various ways to discipline
   our children ... we are saying to parents that help is here, don't give
   up," said Gage-Grey.
