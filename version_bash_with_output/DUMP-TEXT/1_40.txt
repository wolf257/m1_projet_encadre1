   A 42-year-old woman went to a Brooklyn apartment in August 2016 to meet
   a self-described spiritual leader for what she thought was a “church
   ceremony.” She had met him at a religious goods store.

   During the ceremony, the man, Nigel Kennedy, started chanting and
   poured a drink that tasted like alcohol into the woman’s mouth,
   prosecutors said. She passed out briefly, then regained consciousness
   and felt someone on top of her. The next morning she awoke naked on an
   unfamiliar bed, feeling nauseous and dizzy, and realized she had been
   raped, prosecutors said.

   Mr. Kennedy, 51, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in State Supreme Court
   in Brooklyn to charges of rape and sexual abuse. He is accused of
   drugging and raping two women in Brooklyn during separate religious
   ceremonies two years apart, and faces up to 25 years in prison if
   convicted of the top charge. Justice William Miller set Mr. Kennedy’s
   bail at $35,000, which he posted.

   “This defendant is a sexual predator who used his religious stature to
   lure women, then drugged and raped them,” the Brooklyn district
   attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said in a statement.

   The most recent attack was in May, prosecutors said, when Mr. Kennedy
   held another “spiritual reading” for a 28-year-old woman in his home in
   East Flatbush. After blowing smoke in her face, he poured a liquid that
   tasted like alcohol into her mouth; she threw up, but he forced her to
   drink the liquid again, prosecutors said, and she later lost
   consciousness. When she woke, Mr. Kennedy was having sex with her,
   prosecutors said. She told him to stop, but he told her, “relax, it’s
   part of the ritual.”

   Reached by telephone, Mr. Kennedy declined to comment on the
   allegations on Wednesday afternoon. The telephone number is linked
   through records to the Psychic Kaballah Network. On its website, the
   business offers the assistance of a “proven international famed
   Kaballah master” who uses “mystical magic” to help people achieve their
   desires.

   A voice mail message greeting for the business suggested that the
   business offered “prayer, deliverance” and “spiritual cleansing or
   healing.”

   Among the services listed on the Psychic Kaballah Network’s site are
   spiritual readings, predictions for the future, protection and casting
   away of evil spirits, and help to “resolve court cases victoriously.”

   The Psychic Kaballah Network’s site claims the business operates with
   “certified psychics.” It also offers spells — described as being so
   effective at getting even with enemies that customers shouldn’t request
   them unless “absolutely necessary” — and magical objects that can
   protect against harm.

   Mr. Kennedy previously owned a storefront religious goods shop in East
   Flatbush that no longer operates, the district attorney’s office said.
   He met both women there.

   The women sought medical attention soon after the alleged attacks and
   forensic evidence was collected, prosecutors said. The second victim
   later identified Mr. Kennedy as her attacker, and he was arrested in
   early September after flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport
   from Trinidad.

   A grand jury handed up the 13-count indictment on Sept. 20, charging
   him with first- and third-degree rape and first- and second-degree
   sexual abuse, prosecutors said. Mr. Kennedy has no prior arrests, a
   police spokesman said.
