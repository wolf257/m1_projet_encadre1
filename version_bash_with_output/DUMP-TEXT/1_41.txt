   It took 24 years, but a woman who was raped in a Brooklyn park and then
   maligned by police officials and a columnist who doubted her story has
   received what she wanted: a formal apology from the New York City
   police commissioner.

   The commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said in a letter released on Sunday
   that the treatment of the woman and the handling of the case amounted
   to a “miscarriage of justice.”

   Police officials, quoted by a columnist in The Daily News, cast
   aspersions on the woman’s report of being dragged off a path in
   Prospect Park in broad daylight and raped at knife point on April 26,
   1994. Investigators then allowed the case to languish for decades after
   a lab report showed they had been wrong.

   Mr. O’Neill wrote in a letter to the woman that the police had “let her
   down in almost every possible way,” compounding her pain. “For that,”
   he added, “I am deeply and profoundly sorry.”

   It was a remarkable admission of failure by the head of the nation’s
   largest police department, which has struggled recently with
   shortcomings in the Special Victims Division that investigates sex
   crimes.

   Rarely do big-city police commissioners publicly apologize, and Mr.
   O’Neill’s letter seemed to reflect a cultural shift in attitudes toward
   victims of sexual assault and harassment, fanned by the #MeToo
   movement. Mr. O’Neill, a career police officer, has staked his legacy
   on building trust with communities wary of the police.

   The woman, who is African-American and now 52 years old, said in an
   interview that the apology left her feeling grateful and unexpectedly
   emotional.

   “I wanted to see this happen so that the N.Y.P.D. would have to take a
   public stance in support of survivors, so that there would be a public
   statement that would make it clear that it was safe and beneficial for
   survivors to come forward to the police, and that they would not be
   attacked or pilloried by the police,” she said.

   “I was very caught by surprise to see that acknowledged in black and
   white.”

   The commissioner at the time, William J. Bratton, apologized three days
   after the attack for the police role in airing investigators’ doubts
   publicly. But Mr. O’Neill went further, saying they were wrong to doubt
   her in the first place.

   Sonia Ossorio, the president of the New York City arm of the National
   Organization for Women, called the apology “unprecedented.”

   “It’s meaningful to all survivors, and it sends a message,” she said.
   “You can’t move forward until you recognize and acknowledge what has
   been failing. And it really is our greatest hope that this translates
   into a new era for the N.Y.P.D. and police departments across the
   country.”

   The case became a flash point after police officials told the
   columnist, Mike McAlary, that the woman had made up the attack to
   promote a rally for lesbian and gay rights. At the time, the woman said
   she was a lesbian. She now describes herself as bisexual. Nora Ephron
   explored the case in the play “Lucky Guy,” which ran on Broadway in
   2013 with Tom Hanks playing Mr. McAlary.

   The doubts raised in 1994 about the account by the survivor of the
   Prospect Park rape drove a wedge between the police and the overlapping
   communities of sexual assault victims and lesbian and gay people. Mr.
   O’Neill lamented that divide in his letter, singling out the hoax
   accusation as “egregious.”

   “I firmly believe that no one in the N.Y.P.D. would draw such an
   implausible and ridiculous conclusion today,” he added.

   The Police Department reopened the investigation a year ago after
   accusations of sexual assault against the movie producer Harvey
   Weinstein were published, fueling the rise of the #MeToo movement,
   which has felled the careers of more than 200 powerful men and forced a
   national reckoning about consent, sexual assault and believing women
   who make complaints.

   The issues took center stage last month as Christine Blasey Ford
   testified against a judge, Brett M. Kavanaugh, at his confirmation
   hearing for a seat on the Supreme Court.

   When Mr. O’Neill met with advocates for women during the uproar over
   Mr. Weinstein, they told him the Prospect Park case still “cried out
   for acknowledgment,” Ms. Ossorio said.

   In January, semen on the woman’s shorts led officials to identify the
   woman’s attacker as James Edward Webb, a serial rapist who was already
   imprisoned for subsequent attacks on other women. Too much time had
   passed to charge him under a state law that has since been repealed.

   John Miller, a former police spokesman who is now the deputy police
   commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, later apologized
   after The New York Times published a letter from the woman, who said he
   owed it to her.

   Mr. Miller acknowledged that he had been unfair to the woman when, as
   the police spokesman at the time, he revealed that investigators had
   doubts about the woman’s credibility.

   In a column that appeared two days after the attack, Mr. McAlary cited
   unnamed police officials who questioned her account, under the
   headline: “Rape Hoax the Real Crime.” Mr. McAlary, who died of cancer
   in 1998, wrote, “The woman, who will probably end up being arrested
   herself, invented the crime, they said, to promote her rally.”

   When the semen was found, Mr. McAlary wrote that a police official had
   deemed the laboratory wrong. It turned out, however, that top police
   officials involved in the case had misunderstood the technical language
   of the lab report.

   The woman’s DNA had commingled with her attacker’s, and the technology
   that allowed investigators to identify Mr. Webb more than two decades
   later had not been developed. The case went cold, and Mr. Webb raped at
   least four more women.

   The woman filed a libel suit against Mr. McAlary and The Daily News in
   Manhattan Supreme Court that Justice Charles Ramos dismissed in 1997
   after she could not prove the columnist had acted maliciously. Mr.
   Miller gave a deposition on behalf of Mr. McAlary.

   “I am very disappointed that John Miller has never been held
   accountable for the unconscionable statements he made,” the woman said,
   “and all that followed from them.”

   Her lawyer, Martin Garbus, said Mr. O’Neill’s “fantastic” apology was
   undermined by his decision not to take action against officials still
   in the department who damaged the case.

   “The institution takes it on the chin,” Mr. Garbus said. “He’s
   protecting his people there, and he’s protecting sexism and racism.”

   Public apologies often require police officials to walk a fine line
   between admitting mistakes and criticizing the work of their officers.
   Mr. O’Neill drew a backlash from police labor unions in 2016 after he
   said the police had failed when Deborah Danner, a 66-year-old mentally
   ill woman in the Bronx, was shot and killed by a sergeant. The
   sergeant, Hugh Barry, said he had acted in self-defense and was later
   acquitted of murder.

   Other police leaders have expressed regret for their officers’ actions:
   Philadelphia’s police commissioner, Richard Ross, apologized to two
   black men who were arrested while waiting for a business partner at a
   Starbucks, one of several recent instances that have gone viral on
   social media of white people calling the police on black people who
   were doing nothing wrong. The department later changed its arrest
   policy for trespassing.

   Since accusations against Mr. Weinstein became public, more people have
   come forward to the police with complaints about their own
   victimization, and officials have noted an increase among people
   reporting attacks from previous years. As of Oct. 25, the Police
   Department had received 1,487 rape complaints, up nearly 27 percent
   from the 1,178 it had gotten during the same time frame last year. One
   out of every four rapes reported this year was from a prior year,
   compared with one of about every six rapes in 2017.

   A Department of Investigation report in March found that its Special
   Victims Division was understaffed and its investigators poorly trained
   and overworked.

   Mary Haviland, the executive director of the New York City Alliance
   Against Sexual Assault, said the report was devastating to advocates
   who thought the department was trying harder to solve sex crimes.

   After initially rejecting the D.O.I. report, the Police Department
   announced that it was devoting more resources to the unit, including
   hiring more than 36 investigators, just over half of the number the
   report recommended. The police also started “The Call Is Yours,” a
   public service campaign on subways, buses and social media encouraging
   survivors to report their experiences.

   Sexual assault survivors have said the department could still do
   better. Ms. Haviland said their frustrating experiences in having their
   complaints investigated spoke to a need to strengthen the sex crimes
   unit with more experienced investigators and to protect its case
   management system from leaks.

   The City Council is preparing to vote Monday on a legislative package
   that would require the Police Department to put the report’s
   recommendations in effect. The measures include a bill that would
   require all police officers to receive sensitivity training.

   Susan Herman, the deputy commissioner for collaborative policing, said
   the police planned more changes. The apology, while long in the making,
   was an important step, she said, adding, “It’s never too late to do the
   right thing.”
   Correction:

   An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the woman’s
   attacker. He is James Edward Webb, not Edward James Webb.
