   By Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times - Saturday, November 3, 2018

   One of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s accusers admitted this week that
   she made up her lurid tale of a backseat car rape, saying it “was a
   tactic” to try to derail the judge’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.

   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee revealed
   the fraud in a letter to the FBI and Justice Department Friday, asking
   them to prosecute Judy Munro-Leighton for lying to and obstructing
   Congress.

   Mr. Grassley said Ms. Munro-Leighton is a left-wing activist who
   hijacked another “Jane Doe” anonymous report about a backseat rape and
   claimed it as her own story, calling it a “vicious assault.”

   “I am Jane Doe from Oceanside CA — Kavanaugh raped me,” Ms.
   Munro-Leighton wrote in an Oct. 3 email claiming to have been a victim
   of the judge.

   Mr. Grassley’s investigators tried to reach her for a month but were
   unsuccessful until this week, when they spoke to her by phone and she
   confessed that she was not the original Jane Doe, and “did that as a
   way to grab attention.”

   She admitted to the false allegation, and said she has actually never
   met Justice Kavanaugh.

   “I was angry, and I sent it out,” she told investigators.

   “In short, during the committee’s time-sensitive investigation of
   allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Munro-Leighton submitted a
   fabricated allegation, which diverted committee resources,” Mr.
   Grassley wrote. “When questioned by Committee investigators she
   admitted it was false, a ‘ploy,’ and a ‘tactic.’ She was opposed to
   Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation.”

   President Trump seized on the report Saturday, calling her “a vicious
   accuser.”

   “What about the others? Where are the Dems on this?” he demanded via
   Twitter.

   Mr. Grassley has previously asked the FBI to probe Julie Swetnick and
   her lawyer, anti-Trump crusader Michael Avenatti, for lying to Congress
   and obstructing. Ms. Swetnick had originally claimed to have been the
   victim of gang rapes involving Justice Kavanaugh during high school
   parties, saying she saw him and a friend spike punch to leave girls
   unable to resist. She later changed her story to say she saw Justice
   Kavanaugh and his friend near a punch bowl, and could not identify them
   as having actually been part of any rape.

   None of the witnesses she told NBC could corroborate her story were
   able to do so.

   Indeed, NBC found one woman who despite a sworn statement backing up
   Ms. Swetnick, told the network Mr. Avenatti was twisting her words.

   Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was delayed while the
   committee investigated a number of sexual assault and harassment
   claims, none of which have been corroborated by any public evidence to
   date.

   He vehemently denied all of the claims.

   He was confirmed, though only one Democrat joined with all but one
   Republican in backing him.
