   Man facing charges after pizza delivery drivers kidnapped

   MONTGOMERY COUNTY — Two female pizza delivery drivers were kidnapped,
   one of whom was raped, in two separate incidents and now a Dayton man
   is facing multiple felonies for the alleged crimes.

   D'ablo McConnell, 19, was indicted by a grand jury Monday on four
   counts of kidnapping, two counts of rape and single counts of attempted
   rape, assault and aggravated robbery.

   McConnell had a not guilty plea entered on Thursday and his bond was
   set at $250,000.

   McConnell allegedly kidnapped a victim at gunpoint in the first block
   of Sandhurst Drive in Dayton on Oct. 17 around 11:45 p.m., records
   showed.

   The teen then was accused of forcing the victim to drive him in her car
   to the area of Taywood Drive, where he allegedly raped her, courts
   records showed.

   Englewood police said they are investigating a similar case that was
   reported the next night around 10:45 p.m.

   In the Englewood case, McConnell was accused of holding a “realistic
   gun” to a different female victim’s head on West Wenger Road and
   allegedly forced her to drive him in her car to the area of Hillcrest
   Avenue. McConnell was then accused of robbing her and attempted to rape
   her, a criminal complaint read.

   The victim in the Englewood case was able to escape before being raped
   and attempted to flee, however McConnell allegedly choked the victim
   until she passed out, court records read.
   McConnell is expected to be arraigned on the indicted charges Thursday
   and remains in the Montgomery County Jail.
