            Lawsuit filed in alleged Myers Park High School rape
       CHARLOTTE, N.C. - “Help me."
       "Guys, I'm being serious. I'm really scared."
       "Mom, I’m being kidnapped. Call somebody."
       Those are some of the text messages a former Myers Park High School
       student sent to classmates and family during an alleged abduction
       and rape back in 2015 that happened right near the school.
       [ CMPD cold case unit arrests suspect in 1992 rape case ]
       In the nearly 30-page civil suit, an unidentified girl (“Jane Doe”)
       claims that she was walking with student “Q.W.” one school morning
       on campus, and he was pressuring her to skip class, which she
       declined.
       According to court documents, the two were spotted by school
       resource officer Bradley Leak, and he called out to Doe, asking her
       where she was going.
       It also states Q.W. "immediately grabbed and squeezed" Doe’s arm
       and pulled her toward the woods next to campus, despite her verbal
       protest. That's when, according to the lawsuit, the girl started
       sending those frantic texts.  Shortly after, she describes being
       raped by Q.W.
       The suit claims both a friend and the girl's father contacted Leak
       as they were getting these distraught texts, but nothing was done.
       In addition, Leak told the girl’s father that he saw the two leave
       campus and he believed she was skipping class on her own.
       [myerspark-rapelawsuit_1541191493664_13565686_ver1.0_320_240.jpg]
       Eventually, after another call from her parents, the suit states
       Leak and the assistant principal at the time, Anthony Perkins, went
       to look for her and found the two students outside the woods.
       The lawsuit stated, "Her hair was in disarray, she had mud on her
       clothing, her glasses were broken and there was semen on her
       shirt."
       According to the suit, both students were told to sit in the patrol
       car together. When Q.W. was taken out, Doe told the officer she was
       sexually assaulted.
       However, according to the lawsuit, "None of the defendants took a
       statement from her to investigate or resolve the complaint as
       required under Title IX."
       According to the lawsuit, her parents took her to the hospital and
       contacted police.
       Channel 9 tried contacting all parties involved. According to the
       city of Charlotte's website, Leak is employed by the
       Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.
       CMPD officials said they had just received the complaint and that
       it will be reviewed and responded to within the judicial system.
       Officials with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools stated they are unable
       to provide comment on current or pending litigation.
