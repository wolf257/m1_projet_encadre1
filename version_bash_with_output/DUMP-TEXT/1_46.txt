   ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio (WTRF) - The 11-year-old girl was raped in
   Belmont County.

   And the suspect, who has recently turned 18, has admitted to one count
   of rape and will soon be sentenced.

   Now the child's father reveals the shocking twists and turns in the
   case.

   It's the story of one boy, two sisters, and a family that has been torn
   apart.

   It's complicated and shocking, but the younger girl's father says every
   parent needs to hear it.

   Chris Feaster's daughter was 11 when it happened.

   Feaster says Evan Porter of St. Clairsville was at the house a lot,
   dating her older sister, age 17.

   "They got real close and everything," said Feaster, referring to the
   older sister and Porter. "They ended up having a baby. Evan became real
   close with the family."

   But Feaster says in the middle of the night, Porter would sneak out of
   the older sister's bedroom, and seek out the 11-year-old.

   "He would sneak and creep into where my daughter used to sleep, and
   that's where all the awful things happened," Feaster said.

   Now Porter is awaiting sentencing for the one count of rape he admitted
   to.

   And Feaster says his once-outgoing daughter who loved swimming and
   sports has now isolated herself in her room.

   He says she gets bullied at school.

   "People are telling her she should kill herself," he noted.

   Feaster says he would have liked to see Porter tried on all five
   original counts, rather than pleading to a single count,

   But now he has advice to parents everywhere.

   "Don't be your child's friend; be a parent," he says.

   "When you're not a home, there shouldn't be boys--or girls--in the
   house," Feaster advises. "And when you're going to bed, make sure that
   the doors are locked, windows are locked and everybody's out of the
   house."

   He says the older sister has moved out.

   She no longer speaks to the younger sister.

   And Evan Porter could be sentenced to 11 years in prison.

   "It's torn the family apart," said Feaster.

   Feaster himself readily admits he spent two-and-a-half years in prison
   for a drug charge years ago.

   He says now he wants all kids to have clear boundaries.
