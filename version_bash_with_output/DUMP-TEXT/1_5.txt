   ABILENE, Texas —

   A former deacon at an Abilene church was indicted by a Taylor County
   grand jury on Thursday for continuous sexual abuse of a child.

   According to the indictment, Steven Henry Taylor, 50, sexually
   assaulted a child under the age of 14 on multiple occasions between
   January 2008 and May 2013.

   According to documents, the Grand Forks Police Department in North
   Dakota notified the Abilene Police Department of an investigation into
   sexual assault allegations against Taylor, who was formerly a deacon at
   New Hope Church in Abilene.

   A former member of New Hope Church, who attended the church with his
   family while living in Abilene as a teenager, claimed that he was
   sexually abused by Taylor from the time that he was 12 until he was 18.

   According to the victim, Taylor started off by showing him sexually
   explicit images and a short time later, Taylor began to sexually abuse
   him.

   The victim also said that he would spend the night at Taylor's
   residence, where he was subjected to further sexual abuse by Taylor.

   Furthermore, the victim stated that Taylor would sexually assault him
   anywhere from one to three times per week on a weekly basis over a
   period of roughly four years.

   While serving as a deacon at New Hope Church, Taylor conducted many of
   the men's retreats and youth activities held by the church.

   Investigators also believe that many more children may have been
   sexually abused by Taylor.

   New Hope Church, where Taylor formerly served as a deacon, released the
   following statement on Taylor's indictment, which can be read in full
   below:

   It has recently come to our attention that Steve Taylor, a former
   member of New Hope Church between 2002-2009 was arrested and convicted
   in North Dakota on charges of indecency with a child. In that
   investigation it was uncovered that other children were victimized,
   some from Abilene. We are currently cooperating with APD in their
   investigation.

   To do all we can to ensure the safety and well-being of our children on
   a daily basis, all employees, leaders, youth and children’s ministry
   volunteers must go through a criminal background check. This was done
   and returned to us clear. We also maintain a strict policy in all areas
   of youth and children’s ministry, including our Mother’s Day Out
   program, that no adult may be alone with a student or child at any
   time. We work to strictly enforce this policy at all times.

   We are deeply saddened by these events, and our prayers are with all
   who may have been involved.
