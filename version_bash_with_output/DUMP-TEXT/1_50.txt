   PURE EVIL

I was raped by dad from the age of eight – but after telling police I
APOLOGISED to him

   Caryn Walker waived her anonymity to tell her shocking story

   A WOMAN has told how she bought her rapist dad to justice – but not
   before apologising to him for contacting the police.

   Caryn Walker’s evil dad Norman Yeo first abused her when she was just
   eight by showing her pictures of naked women in porn mags.

   He told her “you’ll be like that soon,” the Daily Mirror reported.

   He then moved onto to touching and raping her, carrying on until her
   mid-teens.

   But it was not until her big sister Jenny died aged 36 of a brain
   aneurysm that she went to the police.

   Now 47-year-old Caryn, from Liverpool, has told her story in a memoir
   called: Tell Me You’re Sorry, Daddy.

   In it she revealed how Jenny told her that, aged 16, their dad would
   visit her in her first flat and “demand sex”.

   Caryn told the Mirror: “Our childhoods were just awful but the sad
   thing is, I thought the way we lived was normal.

   “No one ever told me they loved me, or read me a bedtime story. I was
   in my twenties before anyone gave me a hug.

   “I hated every second of what my dad did to me. I was so little and it
   was so painful but he lied and told me all dads did this to their
   daughters.

   “I never thought I’d find the courage to go to the police. I assumed
   these terrible things must somehow be my fault. I’m speaking out for
   Jenny.

   “She always said she wanted to write a book about what happened to us
   but now it’s up to me.”

   I hated every second of what my dad did to me. I was so little and it
   was so painful but he lied and told me all dads did this to their
   daughters.
   Caryn Walker

   Caryn, mum to Karl, 29, added how it was a chance meeting with her dad,
   at a nursing home while she was visiting her gran in 2010 that prompted
   her to take action.

   She visited police and he was arrested on suspicion of abusing her.  In
   2011 it it took jurors at Liverpool Crown Court just two hours to
   convict Yeo, then 63, of Liverpool, of eight offences of rape and five
   charges of indecent assault.

   He had admitted 10 charges of indecent assault.

   Jailing him for 16 years, Judge John Phipps said: “This case concerns
   regular, repeated systematic abuse. You are disgusted with yourself…
   and so you should be”

   Caryn told the Liverpool Echo: “I was so damaged at that time that I
   actually called Norman and apologised – not for going to the police but
   because other members of the family now knew about it.”
