Open letter to U.S. bishops: Make prelates mandatory reporters of abuse

   PHILADELPHIA — An open letter to the U.S. bishops asks that at their
   Nov. 12-14 fall general meeting in Baltimore, they make it mandatory
   for bishops to become reporters of suspected sexual abuse.

   “The nefarious actions of certain bishops surreptitiously transferring
   sexually abusive priests from parish to parish, and in some cases from
   diocese to diocese, without notifying civil authorities of the
   suspected abuse has been one of the most demoralizing elements of this
   crisis,” said the letter, from the Villanova University Task Force on
   the Sexual Abuse Crisis in the Church.

   “Children being abused by priests is tragic enough, but when our
   bishops, who are supposed to be our spiritual and moral leaders, not
   only abandon our children in their time of need but actually become
   complicit in that abuse by actively covering it up, we must ensure that
   effective and rigorous standards are instituted so that children will
   truly be safe,” the letter said. “American bishops should never have
   the option of looking the other way and remaining silent again.”

   The open letter, posted on the university’s website, was signed by 13
   members of the task force, and about 140 Villanova faculty members and
   senior officials.

   The letter’s signers also want the bishops to launch and fund a
   long-term study on the clergy sex abuse crisis.

   “While a great deal of information has been uncovered as a result of
   legal and civil proceedings, we are only beginning to understand what
   really happened. Quite clearly, the widespread nature of this crisis
   indicates systemic problems at every level in the church, and piecemeal
   attempts to deal with these problems will be ineffectual,” the letter
   said.

   “What is sorely needed is rigorous, sustained attention from a range of
   competent laity — including non-Catholics — who will make sense out of
   the full range of contributory factors to this crisis, and who will
   also identify necessary structural adjustments.”

   The letter also asked the bishops to facilitate conversations about the
   crisis from the national level to the parish level in “ something akin
   to a truth and reconciliation commission.”

   The letter acknowledged this abuse crisis is not “a uniquely American
   phenomenon, as patterns of widespread sexual abuse and ecclesiastical
   malfeasance have emerged in a number of countries, including Chile,
   Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Austria, Brazil, Spain,
   Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

   The signers applauded the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for the
   2002 “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People” and
   subsequent revisions.

   They said they were grateful to the USCCB Administrative Committee for
   outlining in a September statement actions to address the abuse crisis,
   including approving the establishment of a third-party confidential
   reporting system for claims of any abuse by bishops.

   Committee members also initiated the process of developing a code of
   conduct for bishops and looking at policies addressing restrictions on
   bishops who were removed or resigned because of allegations of abuse of
   minors or adults.

   However, the letter continued, “the USCCB still has not required
   American bishops to become mandatory reporters of suspected sexual
   abuse.”

   It said, “The entire Catholic family is aghast at the abuse that has
   been perpetrated, and the only way to deal with the pain and
   bewilderment felt by Catholics worldwide is to allow victims of abuse
   to tell their stories, and to encourage Catholics to ask questions
   about why it happened, to show kindness and compassion and solidarity
   to those who have been abused, and to begin to fashion a safer and
   loving church that protects and nurtures its children.”

   “The Catholic Church in the U.S.A. is at a defining moment,” the letter
   noted. The bishops’ meeting, it said, “could inaugurate a new era in
   the American church, one characterized by honesty, accountability,
   generosity and love. Yet this will only happen if the USCCB embarks on
   an ambitious agenda to deal openly with this crisis in a sustained and
   coordinated manner.”
