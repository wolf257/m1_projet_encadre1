   The Diocese of Steubenville has voluntarily released the names of 16
   priests and a seminarian who have been credibly accused or admitted to
   sexual abuse of a minor and removed from active ministry.

   STEUBENVILLE, Ohio —

   The Diocese of Steubenville has voluntarily released the names of 16
   priests and a seminarian who have been credibly accused or admitted to
   sexual abuse of a minor and removed from active ministry.

   The list dates back to the beginning of the formation of the diocese in
   1944, and most of the allegations involve cases from decades ago.

   “It will help survivors of sexual abuse find the strength to come
   forward and these innocent victims can begin the process of healing,”
   Bishop Jeffrey M. Monforton said. “I pledge to do everything possible
   to protect our youth.”

   The list of those credibly accused was developed with the assistance of
   the diocese’s Child Protection Review Board and the diocesan attorney.

   The diocese’s Child Protection Review Board, which was established to
   assist the bishop in complying with the requirements of the “Charter
   for the Protection of Children and Young People,” is comprised of
   mostly laypeople, including civil legal professionals, counselors, and
   its members, who assess all allegations of sexual abuse of minors by
   priests, seminarians and deacons in this diocese.

   The list of names of priests who have served in the Diocese of
   Steubenville and have been credibly accused of at least one act of
   sexual abuse of a minor consists of:

   Cletus Altermatt, suspended from ministry in 1952 (deceased);

   Elwood Bernas, suspended from ministry in 1986;

   Robert A. Brown (deceased);

   Vincent Danko, suspended from ministry in 1971 (deceased);

   H. Christopher Foxhoven, suspended from ministry Oct. 27, 2018;

   Harold Goschke, suspended from ministry in 1957 (deceased);

   Kenneth Harris, suspended from ministry in 1963 (deceased);

   Michael Hellmer, suspended from ministry in 1989 (deceased);

   John “Jack” Holmes, suspended from ministry in 1989 (deceased);

   Anthony Jablonowski, suspended from ministry in 2003, dismissed from
   the clerical state by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006;

   Robert F. Marrer, deceased;

   Joseph A. Martinkosky, suspended from ministry in 1991;

   John Nadzam, suspended from ministry in 2004 (deceased);

   Walter Plimmer, suspended from ministry in 1956 (deceased);

   Francis Rothbauer, suspended from ministry in 1998 (deceased);

   Joel Wright, pre-theology seminarian who never became a candidate for
   ordination; dismissed as a seminarian in January 2016, convicted in
   July 2016.

   Gary Zalenski, suspended from ministry in 2007, dismissed from the
   clerical state as a result of an ecclesiastical trial in 2014.

   A retired priest who was removed from active ministry in May 2018,
   because of allegations of sexual abuse of a minor, is not on the list
   because Belmont County law enforcement authorities are currently
   investigating the case. Any religious order priests were not included,
   because they are under the jurisdiction of their religious order
   superiors.

   The list of names will also be given to prosecuting attorneys in the
   counties where the alleged abuse occurred. The list will be updated,
   when necessary, and will be available on the diocese’s website,
   www.diosteub.org. For the purposes of this list, a “credible
   accusation” against a priest, deacon or seminarian of the Diocese of
   Steubenville is an accusation that, after a thorough investigation and
   review of available information, appears more likely true than not, in
   the judgement of the diocesan review board, and is accepted as credible
   by the bishop.

   Any situation where an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor is
   reported after the death of the accused cleric will be presented to the
   review board for a full investigation.

   Such allegations are difficult to be investigated to the fullest extent
   possible, because the accused is deceased and, therefore, it can be
   difficult to arrive at a decisive conclusion regarding the allegation.
   Because the cleric was deceased when the allegation was reported to the
   diocese, no canonical penal process could take place.

   The Diocese of Steubenville stands firm in its commitment to
   investigate any allegation of sexual abuse by a member of the clergy
   and to listen to, and support, anyone who has been abused. The bishop
   encourages everyone to report suspected cases of sexual abuse of minors
   by personnel of the Diocese of Steubenville to the diocese and local
   civil authorities. In the diocese of Steubenville, contact Father James
   M. Dunfee, vicar general, at (740) 282-3631, or jdunfee@diosteub.org.

   “I say to the victims and to all, for the actions of those with the
   care of souls who have acted in these horrible ways, as your bishop, I
   am very sorry,” Bishop Monforton said.
