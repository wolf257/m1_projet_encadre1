arrest

   A ninth arrest in connection to a suspected child porn and abuse ring
   has local investigators reeling.

   Battle Creek resident Donald Johnston is charged with raping a young
   boy numerous times over the last year. Investigators found nearly 50
   pages of graphic text messages on Johnston's phone detailing his
   alleged abuse. Police said this multi-county child porn ring is more
   insidious because it's people who know each other.

   In light of these disturbing accusations, news channel three spoke to a
   child psychologist about how to talk to your children about sensitive
   issues. The director of the Child Advocacy Center in Kalamazoo is
   sharing important information that could help you find out if your
   child has been abused. This is never an easy thing to talk about, but
   that's exactly what you need to do with your child.

   This latest arrest in connection to an alleged child porn and abuse
   ring turned up a victim that is four years old. Sexual abuse at that
   age can be very hard to uncover.

   "It's going to be more so about their behavior that you're looking at.
   You're looking at them as far as maybe bet wetting. If they are bed
   wetting a little bit more, if they are acting out sexually," said Joel
   Eisinger, director of the Child Advocacy Center.

   Eisinger said the Child Advocacy Center partners with Michigan State
   Police to investigate child sexual abuse. He said you can find out if
   your young child has been abused by asking them the right questions.

   "Using more open-ended questions. At 3 years old, you're going to get a
   lot of yes and no. And just asking them what they saw? What did they
   experience? Asking them what were you looking at today?" Eisinger said.

   Michigan State Police said the hardest part of investigating these
   types of cases is establishing a relationship with the child. Getting
   the case to court is also a challenge.

   "Sometimes it can be. A lot times we rely on, you know, sometimes there
   might be witnesses, DNA evidence. Sometimes getting their
   statement/confessions. There are a lot of factors we rely on," said MSP
   Sgt. Brian Kastelic,

   If you sense your child has been abused, contacting a child
   psychologist is a good next step. Here is a link to the Child Advocacy
   Center's web page where you can find more information.
