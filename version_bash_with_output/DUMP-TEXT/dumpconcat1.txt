Charleston Diocese priest accused of sexual abuse in civil lawsuit spanning
two states

   CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) —

   A man sexually assaulted by a priest in Georgia now says it wasn't just
   one, but two priests who abused him as a child, He claims the second
   priest was a pastor from the Diocese of Charleston .

   Our story starts in Savannah, Georgia. “Everybody I knew was Catholic,”
   Chris Templeton said, one of five children growing up in Savannah in
   the 80s.

   “I was 4th generation Irish Catholic in Savannah and we lived in a
   neighborhood right across the street from the church.”

   His parents were active in Savannah's St. James Catholic Church and
   School, a member of the templeton kids attended St. James for 27
   straight years.

   “There was a six, seven or eight groups of us that all during the
   summer went to St. James' field and play football, baseball, and
   basketball. All of a sudden, there was a new priest there that had a
   Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. He loved coming to watch us,” Templeton
   said.

   A priest named Wayland Brown. The same Savannah priest who is now
   behind bars in South Carolina, serving 20 years for sexually assaulting
   children, but not before he met 13-year-old Templeton.

     “That’s how it all started. [Brown] would take me to the convenience
     store and buy us icees, candy, stuff like that, until it led into
     the abuse.”

   Abuse that spilled across the South Carolina state line, according to
   indictments.

     “I was raped in South Carolina so many times.”

   Templeton says he has only regained memory of the abuse in the past
   four years. In a civil lawsuit, he claims another Charleston priest was
   involved in the abuse with Brown, Father Raymond DuMouchel.

   “All I could think of was a guy, this Father Ray, Father Ray,”
   Templeton recalled. DuMonchel was the pastor at St. Anthony's Mission
   Church in Hardeeville, part of the Charleton Catholic Diocese.

     “I was raped numerous times between Ray DuMouchel and Wayland
     Brown," Templeton says. "Over 60 times."

   According to the Charleston Diocese, it became aware of inappropriate
   conduct by Father DuMouchel in November 2002, after he retired. The
   Diocese suspended him from the ministry.

   At one point, DuMouchel faced fondling charges. Prosecutors dropped
   them, and he died in 2006.

   “What makes Chris’ case unique [...] was the depth of the deceit with
   regard to Wayland Brown's abuse of children,” says Mark Tate,
   Templeton’s lawyer.

     “Can you ever make up for the loss of your youth? Can you ever make
     up for the loss of innocence? You can't do that. And we can't wave a
     magic wand and go back and make things better. But, we can try to
     win a verdict for him."

   The Diocese of Charleston filed its answer in the Templeton case on
   Monday morning, when it said it will continue to address this lawsuit
   in court.

     “We have offered Mr. Templeton professional counseling services and
     pastoral care through his (South Carolina) attorney, Mr. Gregg
     Meyers,” the diocese said in a statement.

   Raised in a large Catholic family in Savannah, Chris Templeton chose to
   stay in the city he loved. But Templeton believes there were more
   victims that have not come forward, who could no longer bear the
   reminder and moved away.

   Are there more Chris Templetons out there? He believes so:

     “There's a bunch, [who] probably want to die, but don’t know how to
     kill themselves. They don’t want to get out of bed everyday, or they
     are getting high, or they are in prison or getting drunk every day.
     They are sad, they are lonely, and they are shameful. Shame and
     guilt will destroy you, and there is a lot of that involved when you
     are raped as a child.”

   Templeton says he now wonders about the boys at his small parochial
   school. He says he knows of four or five boys within a grade or two who
   committed suicide. Too many, and he wants to know why.

   If anyone has information about other or similar crimes, they're asked
   to call the District Attorney's Office in Chatham County, Georgia at
   912-652-8080.

   "Partnership," and how this program promotes success, became the recent
   focus of the Bradley County Health Council.

   The guest speaker during the organization's recent gathering was
   RaShina Viverette, who spoke of how the program works within a
   four-county region of Southeast Tennessee, including Bradley.

   Partnership has over 20 programs that provide individuals and families
   with the tools and resources to build stability and create
   independence. These programs impact the entire circle of ages, from
   young to elderly, but are not meant to help an individual for a day,
   month or even a year. Instead, the programs aim to help people develop
   a lifetime of success and the skills needed to do just that.

   â€œWe work with five different centers of service, including youth
   services, family strengthening services, crisis services, deaf services
   and elder services,â€� Viverette stated.

   Viverette works with Bradley, McMinn, Polk and Meigs counties and helps
   people get through the organizationâ€™s Family First Program to help
   them become self-sufficient in a short time frame.

   For victims of abuse, Partnership offers housing in safe environments
   as well as court advocates who work with the victims to grant them
   orders of protection from their abusers. Accompanying this is its rape
   crisis center, which provides medical treatment, forensic exams,
   counseling and legal advocacy for victims of sexual assault.

   One big identifier of abuse can be if a person in your life is
   constantly talking down to you. In many abuse situations, the abused
   will not want to acknowledge theyâ€™ve been in these situations because
   they havenâ€™t been physically hit; however, abusers can control their
   victims through a number of methods like not letting them have a job,
   keeping them at home at all times or only allowing their victims to
   work at a particular location.

   â€œThe people who abuse others create a sense of fear in their
   victims,â€� Viverette said. â€œOn average, 20 people experience
   domestic violence every minute. This affects 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9
   men. We often focus only on services for females and forget about the
   fact that men can be abused too.â€�

   Unfortunately, Viverette said that the statistics may be
   under-representing the actual abuse taking place overall, as many of
   those abused â€” especially men â€” are unwilling or embarrassed to
   come forward to authorities about the abuse. Over 19 million women and
   5 million men have been stalked as well, and Viverette stated that when
   they hear a stalking case, they try to get a sense of the severity of
   the situation and immediately protect the victim with an order of
   protection. Many times, the stalker is a person who the victim has
   known in the past, such as a significant other.

   Independence for seniors is also paramount, as Partnershipâ€™s
   homemakers assist the elderly with daily tasks such as housekeeping,
   grocery shopping and accompaniment to the doctor. The company also
   offers healing to elder and disabled victims of abuse and financial
   exploitation.

   Following Viveretteâ€™s presentation, health educator Amy Davenport
   explained how on Dec. 5, the health department is providing free flu
   vaccines from 4-7 p.m at the Cleveland Family YMCA. For more
   information, contact the Bradley County Health Department. After
   several other individual updates, the meeting was concluded.

   The Bradley County Health Council will meet again on Nov. 20, at
   Peerless Road Church.Â

Horrific! - 20% spike in child abuse cases reported to CPFSA so far this year

   The Child Protection and Family Services Agency (CPFSA) has reported a
   20 per cent increase in the number of abuse cases being reported to its
   investigators, with some blood-curdling cases on the list.

   These include a case where a three-year-old boy was beaten to death,
   allegedly by a step-parent.

   Another three-year-old boy was burnt with a pot of hot soup thrown on
   him by his mother, while a three-year-old girl suffered a broken
   shoulder from an abusive mother.

   In one case, a six-year-old girl was being beaten and left on the
   roadside at night while another six-year-old girl was stabbed in the
   neck by her mother for spilling soap powder.

   These are included in the almost 13,000 cases reported to the CPFSA
   between January and September this year. This is only 820 short of the
   total number of cases reported to the agency for all of 2017.


230 PREGNANT AFTER ABUSE


   According to CPFSA investigators, at least 1,193 of the reports
   received this year were for incidents of sexual abuse, with at least 12
   of the children sexually abused allegedly by persons employed to care
   for them.

   More than 230 of the children sexually abused were left pregnant.

   "Since the start of the year, our investigations team has dealt with a
   total of 2,327 cases of sexual abuse, with Kingston and St Andrew
   recording 463 of these cases," CEO of the CPFSA Rosalee Gage-Grey told
   The Gleaner as she described the numbers as disheartening.

   "As it relates to physical abuse matters, we note that Kingston and St
   Andrew remain the dominant parishes with a total of 425, while St Ann
   recorded the second highest, with 263.

   "With regard to negligence, Kingston and St Andrew recorded 377,
   Manchester recorded 320, while Westmoreland recorded 266," added​
   Gage-Grey.

   She said that the CPFSA would soon roll out an
   '#everychilddeservesprotection' campaign to combat the rising number of
   incidents on the island.

   "It is very disheartening to see how our children are treated. We are
   coming from the standpoint that there are various ways to discipline
   our children ... we are saying to parents that help is here, don't give
   up," said Gage-Grey.

   ABILENE, Texas —

   A former deacon at an Abilene church was indicted by a Taylor County
   grand jury on Thursday for continuous sexual abuse of a child.

   According to the indictment, Steven Henry Taylor, 50, sexually
   assaulted a child under the age of 14 on multiple occasions between
   January 2008 and May 2013.

   According to documents, the Grand Forks Police Department in North
   Dakota notified the Abilene Police Department of an investigation into
   sexual assault allegations against Taylor, who was formerly a deacon at
   New Hope Church in Abilene.

   A former member of New Hope Church, who attended the church with his
   family while living in Abilene as a teenager, claimed that he was
   sexually abused by Taylor from the time that he was 12 until he was 18.

   According to the victim, Taylor started off by showing him sexually
   explicit images and a short time later, Taylor began to sexually abuse
   him.

   The victim also said that he would spend the night at Taylor's
   residence, where he was subjected to further sexual abuse by Taylor.

   Furthermore, the victim stated that Taylor would sexually assault him
   anywhere from one to three times per week on a weekly basis over a
   period of roughly four years.

   While serving as a deacon at New Hope Church, Taylor conducted many of
   the men's retreats and youth activities held by the church.

   Investigators also believe that many more children may have been
   sexually abused by Taylor.

   New Hope Church, where Taylor formerly served as a deacon, released the
   following statement on Taylor's indictment, which can be read in full
   below:

   It has recently come to our attention that Steve Taylor, a former
   member of New Hope Church between 2002-2009 was arrested and convicted
   in North Dakota on charges of indecency with a child. In that
   investigation it was uncovered that other children were victimized,
   some from Abilene. We are currently cooperating with APD in their
   investigation.

   To do all we can to ensure the safety and well-being of our children on
   a daily basis, all employees, leaders, youth and children’s ministry
   volunteers must go through a criminal background check. This was done
   and returned to us clear. We also maintain a strict policy in all areas
   of youth and children’s ministry, including our Mother’s Day Out
   program, that no adult may be alone with a student or child at any
   time. We work to strictly enforce this policy at all times.

   We are deeply saddened by these events, and our prayers are with all
   who may have been involved.

Open letter to U.S. bishops: Make prelates mandatory reporters of abuse

   PHILADELPHIA — An open letter to the U.S. bishops asks that at their
   Nov. 12-14 fall general meeting in Baltimore, they make it mandatory
   for bishops to become reporters of suspected sexual abuse.

   “The nefarious actions of certain bishops surreptitiously transferring
   sexually abusive priests from parish to parish, and in some cases from
   diocese to diocese, without notifying civil authorities of the
   suspected abuse has been one of the most demoralizing elements of this
   crisis,” said the letter, from the Villanova University Task Force on
   the Sexual Abuse Crisis in the Church.

   “Children being abused by priests is tragic enough, but when our
   bishops, who are supposed to be our spiritual and moral leaders, not
   only abandon our children in their time of need but actually become
   complicit in that abuse by actively covering it up, we must ensure that
   effective and rigorous standards are instituted so that children will
   truly be safe,” the letter said. “American bishops should never have
   the option of looking the other way and remaining silent again.”

   The open letter, posted on the university’s website, was signed by 13
   members of the task force, and about 140 Villanova faculty members and
   senior officials.

   The letter’s signers also want the bishops to launch and fund a
   long-term study on the clergy sex abuse crisis.

   “While a great deal of information has been uncovered as a result of
   legal and civil proceedings, we are only beginning to understand what
   really happened. Quite clearly, the widespread nature of this crisis
   indicates systemic problems at every level in the church, and piecemeal
   attempts to deal with these problems will be ineffectual,” the letter
   said.

   “What is sorely needed is rigorous, sustained attention from a range of
   competent laity — including non-Catholics — who will make sense out of
   the full range of contributory factors to this crisis, and who will
   also identify necessary structural adjustments.”

   The letter also asked the bishops to facilitate conversations about the
   crisis from the national level to the parish level in “ something akin
   to a truth and reconciliation commission.”

   The letter acknowledged this abuse crisis is not “a uniquely American
   phenomenon, as patterns of widespread sexual abuse and ecclesiastical
   malfeasance have emerged in a number of countries, including Chile,
   Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Austria, Brazil, Spain,
   Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

   The signers applauded the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for the
   2002 “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People” and
   subsequent revisions.

   They said they were grateful to the USCCB Administrative Committee for
   outlining in a September statement actions to address the abuse crisis,
   including approving the establishment of a third-party confidential
   reporting system for claims of any abuse by bishops.

   Committee members also initiated the process of developing a code of
   conduct for bishops and looking at policies addressing restrictions on
   bishops who were removed or resigned because of allegations of abuse of
   minors or adults.

   However, the letter continued, “the USCCB still has not required
   American bishops to become mandatory reporters of suspected sexual
   abuse.”

   It said, “The entire Catholic family is aghast at the abuse that has
   been perpetrated, and the only way to deal with the pain and
   bewilderment felt by Catholics worldwide is to allow victims of abuse
   to tell their stories, and to encourage Catholics to ask questions
   about why it happened, to show kindness and compassion and solidarity
   to those who have been abused, and to begin to fashion a safer and
   loving church that protects and nurtures its children.”

   “The Catholic Church in the U.S.A. is at a defining moment,” the letter
   noted. The bishops’ meeting, it said, “could inaugurate a new era in
   the American church, one characterized by honesty, accountability,
   generosity and love. Yet this will only happen if the USCCB embarks on
   an ambitious agenda to deal openly with this crisis in a sustained and
   coordinated manner.”

   The Diocese of Steubenville has voluntarily released the names of 16
   priests and a seminarian who have been credibly accused or admitted to
   sexual abuse of a minor and removed from active ministry.

   STEUBENVILLE, Ohio —

   The Diocese of Steubenville has voluntarily released the names of 16
   priests and a seminarian who have been credibly accused or admitted to
   sexual abuse of a minor and removed from active ministry.

   The list dates back to the beginning of the formation of the diocese in
   1944, and most of the allegations involve cases from decades ago.

   “It will help survivors of sexual abuse find the strength to come
   forward and these innocent victims can begin the process of healing,”
   Bishop Jeffrey M. Monforton said. “I pledge to do everything possible
   to protect our youth.”

   The list of those credibly accused was developed with the assistance of
   the diocese’s Child Protection Review Board and the diocesan attorney.

   The diocese’s Child Protection Review Board, which was established to
   assist the bishop in complying with the requirements of the “Charter
   for the Protection of Children and Young People,” is comprised of
   mostly laypeople, including civil legal professionals, counselors, and
   its members, who assess all allegations of sexual abuse of minors by
   priests, seminarians and deacons in this diocese.

   The list of names of priests who have served in the Diocese of
   Steubenville and have been credibly accused of at least one act of
   sexual abuse of a minor consists of:

   Cletus Altermatt, suspended from ministry in 1952 (deceased);

   Elwood Bernas, suspended from ministry in 1986;

   Robert A. Brown (deceased);

   Vincent Danko, suspended from ministry in 1971 (deceased);

   H. Christopher Foxhoven, suspended from ministry Oct. 27, 2018;

   Harold Goschke, suspended from ministry in 1957 (deceased);

   Kenneth Harris, suspended from ministry in 1963 (deceased);

   Michael Hellmer, suspended from ministry in 1989 (deceased);

   John “Jack” Holmes, suspended from ministry in 1989 (deceased);

   Anthony Jablonowski, suspended from ministry in 2003, dismissed from
   the clerical state by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006;

   Robert F. Marrer, deceased;

   Joseph A. Martinkosky, suspended from ministry in 1991;

   John Nadzam, suspended from ministry in 2004 (deceased);

   Walter Plimmer, suspended from ministry in 1956 (deceased);

   Francis Rothbauer, suspended from ministry in 1998 (deceased);

   Joel Wright, pre-theology seminarian who never became a candidate for
   ordination; dismissed as a seminarian in January 2016, convicted in
   July 2016.

   Gary Zalenski, suspended from ministry in 2007, dismissed from the
   clerical state as a result of an ecclesiastical trial in 2014.

   A retired priest who was removed from active ministry in May 2018,
   because of allegations of sexual abuse of a minor, is not on the list
   because Belmont County law enforcement authorities are currently
   investigating the case. Any religious order priests were not included,
   because they are under the jurisdiction of their religious order
   superiors.

   The list of names will also be given to prosecuting attorneys in the
   counties where the alleged abuse occurred. The list will be updated,
   when necessary, and will be available on the diocese’s website,
   www.diosteub.org. For the purposes of this list, a “credible
   accusation” against a priest, deacon or seminarian of the Diocese of
   Steubenville is an accusation that, after a thorough investigation and
   review of available information, appears more likely true than not, in
   the judgement of the diocesan review board, and is accepted as credible
   by the bishop.

   Any situation where an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor is
   reported after the death of the accused cleric will be presented to the
   review board for a full investigation.

   Such allegations are difficult to be investigated to the fullest extent
   possible, because the accused is deceased and, therefore, it can be
   difficult to arrive at a decisive conclusion regarding the allegation.
   Because the cleric was deceased when the allegation was reported to the
   diocese, no canonical penal process could take place.

   The Diocese of Steubenville stands firm in its commitment to
   investigate any allegation of sexual abuse by a member of the clergy
   and to listen to, and support, anyone who has been abused. The bishop
   encourages everyone to report suspected cases of sexual abuse of minors
   by personnel of the Diocese of Steubenville to the diocese and local
   civil authorities. In the diocese of Steubenville, contact Father James
   M. Dunfee, vicar general, at (740) 282-3631, or jdunfee@diosteub.org.

   “I say to the victims and to all, for the actions of those with the
   care of souls who have acted in these horrible ways, as your bishop, I
   am very sorry,” Bishop Monforton said.

Experts speak out about investigating sexual abuse after child porn ring
arrest

   by Anna Giles | Newschannel 3

   A ninth arrest in connection to a suspected child porn and abuse ring
   has local investigators reeling.

   A ninth arrest in connection to a suspected child porn and abuse ring
   has local investigators reeling.

   Battle Creek resident Donald Johnston is charged with raping a young
   boy numerous times over the last year. Investigators found nearly 50
   pages of graphic text messages on Johnston's phone detailing his
   alleged abuse. Police said this multi-county child porn ring is more
   insidious because it's people who know each other.

   In light of these disturbing accusations, news channel three spoke to a
   child psychologist about how to talk to your children about sensitive
   issues. The director of the Child Advocacy Center in Kalamazoo is
   sharing important information that could help you find out if your
   child has been abused. This is never an easy thing to talk about, but
   that's exactly what you need to do with your child.

   This latest arrest in connection to an alleged child porn and abuse
   ring turned up a victim that is four years old. Sexual abuse at that
   age can be very hard to uncover.

   "It's going to be more so about their behavior that you're looking at.
   You're looking at them as far as maybe bet wetting. If they are bed
   wetting a little bit more, if they are acting out sexually," said Joel
   Eisinger, director of the Child Advocacy Center.

   Eisinger said the Child Advocacy Center partners with Michigan State
   Police to investigate child sexual abuse. He said you can find out if
   your young child has been abused by asking them the right questions.

   "Using more open-ended questions. At 3 years old, you're going to get a
   lot of yes and no. And just asking them what they saw? What did they
   experience? Asking them what were you looking at today?" Eisinger said.

   Michigan State Police said the hardest part of investigating these
   types of cases is establishing a relationship with the child. Getting
   the case to court is also a challenge.

   "Sometimes it can be. A lot times we rely on, you know, sometimes there
   might be witnesses, DNA evidence. Sometimes getting their
   statement/confessions. There are a lot of factors we rely on," said MSP
   Sgt. Brian Kastelic,

   If you sense your child has been abused, contacting a child
   psychologist is a good next step. Here is a link to the Child Advocacy
   Center's web page where you can find more information.

Concerns growing about the number of underage boys being abused in Dublin
brothels

A number of suspected brothels have been raided by gardaí in the last year.

   SINCE GARDAÍ RAIDED a suspected brothel in Dublin in March this year,
   concerns have been raised with them about the possibility of a number
   of underage boys being abused elsewhere in the city.

   It is now understood that complaints were made to gardaí about
   teenagers as young as 16 being exploited in a number of areas of north
   Dublin. Some of the information gathered by gardaí has come from adult
   escorts working elsewhere, and independently, in the capital.

   Many of the all-male brothels thought to be involved are located near
   the IFSC and Parnell Street. They use online advertisements and sales
   websites, as well as one well-known escort website, to promote their
   services.

   Information was passed on to An Garda Síochána based in Kilmainham in
   relation to the existence of the brothels following a raid of a
   different premises seven months ago.

   A quantity of cocaine was seized at this building in the north of the
   city.

   Most of the adult male escorts working in Ireland currently are
   Brazilian but there is a growing number of young Irish men, both adult
   and underage, in prostitution.

   Ruhama – an advocacy group which supports people as they exit
   prostitution – said it is aware of a number of male brothels in
   operation in Ireland and confirmed that it had helped young Irish
   minors escape.

   The organisation has confirmed that the name of the alleged ringleader
   has come to their attention but would not comment on specific queries.

   Sarah Benson, Ruhama’s CEO, told TheJournal.ie: “Ruhama is primarily a
   women’s support service given the highly gendered nature of the sex
   trade.

   However, we do engage with a small number of men each year, and have
   encountered men who have been exploited as minors. The sex trade is a
   dangerous and precarious environment for anyone regardless of gender or
   age.

   “We are aware of small numbers of men in prostitution at present in
   Ireland and they often come from the similarly marginalised backgrounds
   to the hundreds of women we meet each year. Their support needs can be
   significant and we will always do what we can to assist them.

   “In all instances where minors are prostituted this is child sexual
   exploitation and should be treated as such by the authorities – there
   is no such thing as a ‘child prostitute’.”

   A factor in the increasing presence of all-male brothels it the
   growing chemsex phenomenon in Dublin.

   According to one male escort, JP*, whoTheJournal.ie spoke to this week,
   many of the brothels are used for chemsex.

   Chemsex is the use of drugs such as G, crystal methamphetamine,
   ketamine and mephedrone to enhance sexual activity. The practice is
   usually associated with men who have sex with men (MSM), often involves
   multiple people and can lead to sexual encounters that last for hours
   or days.

   GHB is a synthetic drug used as an anaesthetic. It comes in a clear
   liquid or powder form and its potency varies. GBL is sold as a
   substitute for GHB. It’s found in cleaning solvents and converts to GHB
   when you swallow it.

   JP explained that short-term lets are being used to facilitate
   independent operations, like his. He counts it as lucky if there is an
   apartment to lease closer to the main entrance door – this means that
   their clients can enter and exit without drawing too much attention.

   However, larger brothels move to new locations more frequently due to
   the increased volume of people using them.

   New laws which took effect last year criminalised the purchase of sex
   in Ireland and many workers have said this has resulted in them working
   on their own, depriving them of security previously available to them.

   Those opposed to the legislation, including the Sex Workers Alliance
   Ireland (SWAI), said that it would make the job of the worker a lot
   more dangerous and that the demand for sex would not be reduced as a
   result.

Thirty-one names on Youngstown Diocese clergy abuse list

   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -

   The Youngstown Diocese is making public a list of priests who have been
   removed from their ministries over credible allegations of sexual
   abuse.

   At a 10 am Tuesday news conference, Bishop George Murry announced that
   of the more than 1,000 men who have been priests and other religious
   leaders in the five-county diocese since it was founded in 1943, 31 men
   have been found to have had credible inappropriate incidents.

   Bishop Murry said former FBI agents investigated 73 complaints about
   alleged abuse in the Diocese.

   The investigators make recommendations to the bishop and a board made
   of attorneys, Catholic and Lutheran pastors, representatives from
   Children Services and others.

   Bishop Murry tells 21 News that legal counsel advised the diocese to
   only release the names of the priests, and not what parishes they
   worked at, or when they served there.

   However, Murry says he has since chosen to defy legal counsel and will
   furnish a list of the parishes each priest or clergyperson worked at.
   21 News will be providing an update once those parishes are made
   public.

   allegations of sexual abuse of a minor have been made while employed in
   the Diocese of Youngstown:

   Stephen Baker, TOR (deceased)

   RELATED COVERAGE: Bishop apologizes to victims of sexual abuse

   The bishop has said that all of the parishes and schools where the
   priests in question had been stationed were notified in writing and
   were invited to contact the diocese if they knew of someone who had
   been abused or abused themselves.

   The Bishop is asking anyone who has been abused to come forward and
   speak with the diocese victim assistance coordinator retired Sergeant
   Delphine Baldwin-Casey at 330-718-1388.”

   Bishop Murry says he has welcomed Mahoning County Prosecutor Paul Gains
   to review files that the Diocese has on priests who have been credibly
   accused of sexual abuse.

   Bishop Murry said that in many cases, victims declined to prosecute
   their alleged abusers. Instead, saying they just wanted them out of the
   ministry.

   Below is a portion of the news release from the Diocese:

     Bishop George V. Murry, S.J., of the Catholic Diocese of Youngstown
     has announced the list of names of those who have served in the
     Diocese of Youngstown since its establishment in 1943 who have been
     credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor and who have been
     reported to civil authorities.

     Bishop Murry states, “I am very sorry that the Church has failed to
     act aggressively to eliminate this evil. I humbly ask forgiveness
     from the victims and their families for the grave mistakes the
     Church has made.”

     For the purpose of this list a “credible accusation” against a
     priest or deacon who has served in the Diocese of Youngstown is an
     accusation that, after a thorough investigation and review of
     available information, appears more likely true than not in the
     judgment of the Diocesan Review Board, and is accepted as credible
     by the bishop.

     The Diocese of Youngstown is committed to comply with local law
     enforcement and with the Charter for the Protection of Children and
     Young People established by the United States Conference of Catholic
     Bishops in 2002. The Charter contains a comprehensive set of
     procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by
     Catholic clergy, along with areas that assist the diocese in efforts
     to provide preventive measures designed to keep minors safe from
     harm now and in the future. Also included are guidelines for
     reconciliation, healing and accountability.

     Through ongoing education, the Diocese of Youngstown strives to
     empower people to create and maintain safe environments for our
     children and youth. Bishop Murry explained, “that as painful as the
     process of voluntary disclosure of names is for parishioners where
     these men served, this is one way that we can offer support and
     dignity to the survivors of clergy sexual abuse and their families.”

     This list will be supplemented based upon any future determinations
     of credible allegations.

   Youngstown is one of several dioceses around the country promising to
   release the names of clergy members accused of abuse.

   Tuesday, October 30, 2018
   LOS ANGELES (KABC) --
   The Los Angeles Unified School District has reached a settlement and
   will pay $5 million to a former student who was molested in a classroom
   by a teacher in 2011.
   The incident occurred at Edison Middle School in the Florence-Firestone
   neighborhood of South L.A. when the victim was 13 years old.
   Attorneys for the young woman, who is now 20, called it the largest
   payout to a single sexual abuse victim made by LAUSD, the
   second-largest school district in the U.S.
   District lawyers say they hope to make payment within 30 days.
   The case prompted state lawmakers to pass new measures involving minors
   and adults in positions of authority.

   UPTOWN — A Chicago psychiatric hospital that treats hundreds of
   children in state care is under federal and state investigation over
   safety concerns and alleged sexual assaults, and it may be forced to
   close if it can’t correct deficiencies.

   The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has
   investigated 16 allegations of abuse and neglect this year at the
   Aurora Chicago Lakeshore Hospital in the city’s Uptown community,
   including allegations that children were raped and sexually abused by
   staff and other patients, physically assaulted and inadequately
   supervised, a ProPublica Illinois investigation found.

   Among those reportedly abused or hurt in the incidents were children
   who were cleared for discharge from the hospital weeks or months
   earlier. DCFS, however, had failed to find them a place to go — a
   persistent issue for the troubled agency that ProPublica Illinois
   documented this year.

   In addition to child welfare investigations, the Illinois Department of
   Public Health has conducted a series of inspections on behalf of
   federal authorities since July that found the hospital had failed to
   ensure the safety of suicidal patients, obtain consent before giving
   patients — including children — powerful medications and sufficiently
   monitor patients.

   Federal authorities have said they will cut off funding that is crucial
   to the hospital’s operations by the end of November if officials there
   do not implement immediate changes, according to federal records and
   court documents.

   Hospital officials declined to answer specific questions from
   ProPublica Illinois, but the CEO, David Fletcher-Janzen, said in a
   statement that they have been working with state and federal
   authorities to fix deficiencies. He said the hospital strives to
   provide a safe, therapeutic environment for patients.

   “Chicago Lakeshore Hospital takes every allegation of impropriety very
   seriously and files reports immediately. All allegations, regardless of
   probability, are reported to maintain a high level of caution and
   transparency,” Fletcher-Janzen said. “Our goal is to improve the lives
   of these young patients so they can grow to be healthy adults both
   physically and mentally.”

   The hospital has come under fire before. State inspection reports in
   recent years found that an employee, who was later terminated,
   repeatedly punched a 26-year-old patient who had hit him; that the
   hospital failed to ensure a safe setting for a 15-year-old girl who
   received 18 stitches after cutting herself by breaking off part of a
   toilet; and that proper precautions were not taken with a patient with
   a history inappropriate sexual behavior, according to records obtained
   through a Freedom of Information Act request.

   In 2010, DCFS hired consultants from the University of Illinois at
   Chicago to conduct a review of Lakeshore and found a host of problems,
   from patients reporting sexual assaults by peers to “lax or
   inconsistent supervision by staff.” Lakeshore officials disputed the
   findings at the time, saying the report was “highly subjective” and
   contained findings “unsupported by the facts.”

   The Chicago Tribune revealed in 2010 that children at the hospital had
   been sexually assaulted.

   Neil Skene, the special assistant to DCFS Acting Director Beverly
   “B.J.” Walker, said the agency is focused on making sure children are
   properly cared for and addressing the issues federal officials have
   identified.

   “We are fulfilling our responsibility to oversee the care of youth who
   are our responsibility,” he said. “We believe that the current
   monitoring bodies will let us know if their concerns rise to a level
   where we need to stop using the hospital. “

   Many of the new allegations echo those of the past. In September, a
   7-year-old girl was taken to the emergency room at UIC after she
   reported that a 12-year-old boy pulled down her pants, sexually
   assaulted her with his finger and “made her bleed,” according to
   confidential reports obtained by ProPublica Illinois.

   While at the emergency room, she also reported that a Lakeshore
   employee had kissed her on the mouth and sexually assaulted her with
   his finger, and said she was “afraid to go back” to Lakeshore. A UIC
   social worker, records show, expressed concerns about delays in
   Lakeshore’s reporting and seeking medical care for the girl.

   That same Lakeshore employee was at the center of another investigation
   in August. A 12-year-old girl reported that the man had locked her
   door, grabbed her by the shirt and touched her breasts. When she tried
   to pull away, she said that he pulled her down onto his lap, squeezed
   her buttocks and made her sit on his lap and touch his penis.

   Both girls are in DCFS care. The agency said it continues to
   investigate the alleged assaults and the employee is not currently
   working at the hospital. Chicago police have also opened an
   investigation.

   DCFS found sufficient evidence to support four other complaints this
   year, including one report in June that an 11-year-old girl sexually
   acted out toward four girls on her unit, according to agency records.

   In yet another case, a 17-year-old boy diagnosed with bipolar disorder
   was left with a bloody mouth and bruising in April after he said two
   male employees dragged him to his room, where they pinned him down
   while holding his arms over the bedrail, according to DCFS records. The
   boy said one of the workers threatened to break his arm.

   He had been admitted to the hospital that day after a suicide attempt,
   his mother said.

   “It’s never easy sending your child to the hospital, but the thing that
   helps you sleep at night is at least you know they’re safe,” the mother
   said in an interview. “But he was far from safe. He was hurt and
   scared.”

   When she arrived at the hospital to visit her son, she said she was
   horrified at the sight of blood on his lips and mouth and bruises on
   his face and arm. She began looking for another hospital to transfer
   him to immediately.

   “I knew I could rescue him from there,” the mother said. “But most of
   the kids there are wards of the state. There is no one to rescue them.”

   Hospital officials did not respond to allegations about individual
   cases. Fletcher-Janzen said employees who are subjects of allegations
   are either suspended or moved to a different building while Lakeshore
   and DCFS investigate.

   The child welfare agency continues to send children to the hospital,
   which serves children and adults in two buildings a few blocks apart.
   Nearly half of the 16 investigations have not been substantiated, and
   the other cases reflect individual incidents rather than a systemic
   problem, Skene said.

   “The question for DCFS is whether children are safe there,” Skene said.
   “Nothing that we are seeing gives us concern for their safety.”

   As of late September, after officials with the Centers for Medicare and
   Medicaid Services notified the hospital it planned to stop making its
   Medicare payments, 18 children in DCFS care were patients there,
   including a 4-year-old boy who had been at the hospital for nearly
   three weeks, according to documents.

   At least three of those children had already been cleared for discharge
   but DCFS had not found them other placements, records show. ProPublica
   Illinois revealed in June that hundreds of children have spent weeks
   and even months trapped in psychiatric hospitals as the agency searched
   for residential treatment centers, foster homes and other placements.

   DCFS acknowledged the problem and said it was working to find more
   appropriate homes.

   The number of DCFS patients at Lakeshore remained at 18 earlier this
   month; some children, including the 4-year-old, had been released, but
   others were admitted as federal and state officials continued their
   inquiries.

   The investigations alarmed Meryl Paniak, DCFS’ acting inspector
   general, who in a confidential memo urged Walker to take action. Paniak
   wrote that she had “significant concerns for the care and safety of the
   children” at Lakeshore, according to a copy of the memo obtained by
   ProPublica Illinois.

   Paniak listed steps the agency could take, ranging from immediately
   planning for alternative placements for the children to sending an
   official to Lakeshore each day to evaluate the hospital’s progress
   resolving its problems.

   DCFS officials complied with nearly all of the recommendations,
   including the daily inspections and making plans to move children. But
   they have not agreed to one of Paniak’s most sweeping recommendations:
   bringing in an independent expert to do a comprehensive review of the
   treatment and mental health services at the hospital.

   In an interview, Paniak said an independent voice could provide
   expertise and objectivity. She said she was disappointed by the
   agency’s decision not to seek an independent review.

   “I don’t think that the department has done enough to ensure the safety
   of the kids there,” Paniak said.

   DCFS relies on Lakeshore to treat children in need of psychiatric
   hospitalization. Last year, of the approximately 1,100 children and
   adolescent patients treated at the hospital, 41 percent were in state
   care, according to court filings from the hospital. The majority of the
   hospital’s revenue comes from Medicaid payments.

   Lakeshore typically sees more children from DCFS than other area
   hospitals because it accepts children with the “highest needs and most
   volatile behaviors (that) other hospitals won’t,” Skene said.

   The majority of the cases that DCFS substantiated or continues to
   investigate involve sexual abuse or assault.

   A 12-year-old boy reported in January that he was fondled by a
   17-year-old. Five other patients reported the teen tried to touch them
   inappropriately when employees were not looking, records show. The
   17-year-old was on probation and was sent to juvenile detention
   following the incidents, according to DCFS documents.

   In that case, DCFS cited hospital staff for inadequate supervision and
   wrote that it was unclear “where responsible staff were” when the abuse
   happened and why a 12-year-old was on the same unit with older teens.

   Another investigation into allegations of inadequate supervision
   involved a 16-year-old from Honduras who had come to the U.S.
   unaccompanied. The girl, who is transgender and in the custody of the
   federal government, reported she had sex with another patient at the
   hospital this summer. That investigation is ongoing.

   DCFS also is investigating an allegation by an 8-year-old boy who said
   one of his roommates climbed on top of him and started “to hump” him
   and another stood next to his bed while masturbating, records show.

   One complication in investigating these cases is the lack of video
   evidence. While the hallways contain cameras, the hospital has not
   provided footage to DCFS investigators on several occasions when asked
   for it, ProPublica Illinois found.

   Skene said the agency has discussed the issue with the hospital, and
   the hospital is in the process of replacing its surveillance system.
   The installation of the new system in the children’s building is
   expected to be completed this week, a hospital representative said.

   “It’s just an awful lot of very serious red flags in a very short
   period of time,” Charles Golbert, Cook County acting public guardian,
   said in an interview. He said children would be better served by an
   independent review of the hospital instead of separate investigations
   done by state and federal agencies.

   He added it’s difficult for DCFS to be objective because it depends on
   Lakeshore to care for so many of its children. Without Lakeshore, he
   said, the agency has few options for psychiatric treatment.

   “That’s a conflict of interest,” he said.

   Last month, Michael Jones, a DCFS senior deputy director, said in court
   records that “significant challenges and harm” would follow if
   Lakeshore lost its federal funding and was unable to treat DCFS
   children, reducing the number of available beds for them by 25 percent.
   He called the hospital a “community partner and a necessary ally for
   DCFS and the children we serve.”

   Jones also said the three other hospitals in Chicago that DCFS
   primarily uses do not always accept children in the agency’s care and
   may not be geographically convenient for some patients.

   But Golbert said there’s another reason other hospitals are reluctant
   to take some children from DCFS. Those children, he said, sometimes end
   up staying weeks or months past their release dates because the agency
   can’t find homes for them. Children who remain locked in psychiatric
   hospitals for long periods of time may suffer additional emotional harm
   and sometimes begin mimicking the negative behaviors they are exposed
   to, including sexual and physical misconduct.

   The 12-year-old boy who allegedly sexually assaulted the 7-year-old
   girl at Lakeshore last month had been admitted to the hospital in June
   and was cleared for discharge three weeks later. But he remained at the
   hospital for nearly four more months because DCFS could not find him an
   appropriate placement.

   The alleged assault occurred during that time. The girl he allegedly
   assaulted was cleared for release at the end of August but did not
   leave until September, a week after the reported incident.

   In addition, one of four girls targeted for sexual acts by an
   11-year-old girl in June was cleared for discharge in May. She remained
   unnecessarily hospitalized for more than three months. And records show
   the 12-year-old girl who an employee allegedly sexually abused in
   August had been on a waiting list to go to a residential treatment
   center for two months.

   Lakeshore’s most recent regulatory troubles began this summer at its
   adult building, though documented concerns there go back several years.
   In the last 12 months, at least two people have filed lawsuits in Cook
   County Circuit Court against the hospital alleging sexual assaults at
   the adult building, including a woman who said an employee followed her
   into a bathroom and raped her. Both lawsuits are pending.

   This year alone, state regulators conducted inspections three times at
   the hospital, in July, August and this month. During the July
   inspection, public health inspectors faulted the hospital for having
   doors that posed a suicide risk. They also found that the hospital did
   not collect samples for a rape kit after a patient alleged she was
   sexually assaulted, failed to complete required safety checks and did
   not obtain informed consent from patients before administering
   psychotropic medications, according to a July 27 report obtained
   through an open records request.

   “IDPH is always concerned about the health and safety of patients and
   when deficiencies are found, we follow-up to make sure they are
   corrected,” department spokeswoman Melaney Arnold said in an email. “In
   situations where the health and safety of patients are in immediate
   jeopardy, the hospital is required to eliminate the immediate jeopardy
   and surveyors stay in the hospital until it does.”

   When state inspectors returned the next month, they found the hospital
   had replaced the doors, but they identified additional suicide risks:
   15 phones with long metal cords hanging from walls in hallways and
   dayrooms.

   “This failure potentially put all 54 patients on suicide precautions,
   at risk for serious harm,” public health investigators wrote in the
   August report.

   About three weeks later, federal authorities issued the notice to
   terminate Lakeshore’s Medicare participation, effective Sept. 28.

   One day before the deadline, Lakeshore attorneys filed an emergency
   motion in federal court to halt the move. The attorneys said the
   hospital serves a unique role as one of the largest behavioral health
   providers in Illinois, treating more than 5,000 patients a year and
   routinely accepting children in state custody.

   The attorneys said the hospital would be forced to close and lay off
   hundreds of employees if its Medicare and Medicaid payments were ended.
   Attorneys argued the hospital is doing its best to comply with suicide
   prevention guidelines that are vague and often change. Safer doors had
   been on back order when inspectors arrived in July. The day after the
   inspection, an employee drove to Wyoming to pick up the doors from the
   manufacturer. In addition, they said the phone cords were removed while
   the inspectors were on site.

   The hospital already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars before the
   inspections to remove and replace equipment that posed suicide risks
   throughout the buildings, according to the hospital’s filings.

   Hospital officials also took issue with some of the state regulators’
   other findings, saying many were related to documentation rather than
   actual patient harm. Still, they submitted a total of three correction
   plans — the most recent one just days ago — they said would “ensure
   patients are able to receive care in a safe setting,” according to
   records.

   Federal regulators have twice extended the termination deadline, but a
   threat still looms. While the hospital addressed many of the
   violations, more emerged in an October inspection. Patients as young as
   14 in the children’s building were given powerful psychotropic
   medications without informed consent, records show.

   With Lakeshore still out of compliance, federal authorities have
   notified hospital officials they are setting a new termination date of
   Nov. 30. On that date, the government will stop reimbursing the
   hospital for patients on Medicare. It is unclear if Medicaid payments
   would be affected. More than 80 percent of the hospital’s patients this
   year were insured through Medicare or Medicaid, according to court
   records.

   The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, which monitors DCFS as
   part of a federal consent decree, has requested additional information
   from the agency about the conditions at Lakeshore in light of the
   ongoing investigations.

   Claire Stewart, an ACLU attorney, said the group also wants an
   independent review of the hospital. The organization is considering
   legal intervention, she added.

   “We will do what we need to do to protect the youth in care,” Stewart
   said. “This is an immediate safety concern and priority.”

Sexual Abuse and Neglect Allegations Swarm Chicago Hospital

Uptown Chicago Psychiatric Hospital “Called Out” After Reports of Sexual
Abuse and Neglect Involving Child Patients

   Although not surprised, the entire legal team at Levin & Perconti has
   been cringing over the recent ProPublica Illinois investigation into
   Chicago Lakeshore Hospital, a private psychiatric facility located in
   the northside of the city. The initial ProPublica findings involve both
   claims of sexual abuse and related disruptions grown from the ongoing
   neglect of young patients in the hospital’s Child and Adolescent
   Behavioral Health Program. The allegations are horrific to say the
   least. Even so, dozens of children have bravely stepped forward and
   shared their personal stories of being raped and sexually abused by
   staff and patients, while others have been physically assaulted. Many
   of the hospital’s hotline complaints in just the last few months were
   triggered from laxed staff who created scenes of abusive sexual
   activity (most forced), and inappropriate or violent altercations
   between children and teenage patients.

   Federal inspection reports in 2018, show the Illinois Department of
   Children and Family Services (DCFS) has investigated 16 allegations of
   abuse and neglect, many sexual in nature, at the hospital between staff
   and child patients, and other hospital residents just this year. As the
   Chicago Tribune recently reported, some pending investigations include
   these sickening allegations:
     * “A 7-year-old girl said a 12-year-old boy pulled down her pants and
       sexually assaulted her with a finger. At the time of the Sept. 10
       incident, the girl had been hospitalized for more than two months
       for homicidal and suicidal behaviors. The boy, who had a history of
       sexual aggression, had been hospitalized for nearly three months.”

     * “…two females accused a male staff member of touching them
       inappropriately. She said the worker kissed her and sexually
       assaulted her with his finger in early September. The other girl,
       who is 12, told a counselor the man touched her breast in late
       August. DCFS and Chicago police are still investigating.”

     * “In April, a 15-year-old patient complained the same worker made
       her feel uncomfortable after he made sexually suggestive comments,
       including that he wanted to be her roommate. The child welfare
       agency determined her complaint was unfounded.”

     * “The mother of an 8-year-old boy called the hotline Sept. 9
       alleging her son was battered by peers, touched sexually and
       exposed to two masturbating roommates during the five days he was
       hospitalized.”

   DCFS investigated and found these 2018 claims credible:
     * “A 10-year-old girl complained her 11-year-old female roommate
       asked her to have sex and was touching other girls in their unit in
       a sexual manner. When questioned, the 11-year-old reported having
       sexual experiences at a previous hospital and at home.”

     * “An April complaint was from the mother of a 17-year-old patient
       with intellectual and mental health issues. The boy suffered a
       bloody mouth and facial cuts and bruising after two staff members
       dragged him to his bedroom and threatened to break his arm while
       pinning him down on his bed, with his arms held over the bed rail,
       according to documents.”

     * “A 12-year-old boy said he was sexually abused by an older teen.
       Several other patients also complained about the teenage boy, who
       was then sent to the juvenile detention center. DCFS found the
       hospital had provided inadequate supervision during the incidents.”

   But because DCFS says it does not carry the authority to regulate the
   private psychiatric hospital which is inspected, licensed and certified
   by state and federal health officials, fixes to prevent these abuse and
   neglect situations in the first place have proven to be inadequate and
   continue to fail the estimated 300 DCFS child and teen patients who are
   treated and hospitalized at the facility each year.

   Chicago Lakeshore has been at risk of losing state and federal funding
   over the many similar abuse and neglect allegations health officials
   have been lurking over – for what feels like years in a repeated
   fashion. State and federal inspectors have also docked the facility for
   the lack of patient monitoring and access to empty rooms, and failed
   documentation of medical history and improper medication use.

Child Patients at Psychiatric Hospitals May Not Have a Home

   Chicago Lakeshore employs about 400 staff members each year,
   responsible for the care and treatment of an estimated 5,000 patients,
   a mix between adults and youth. Most of the children, some as young as
   3-years-old, arrive at the hospital under state care to be treated for
   mental health and abuse and neglect issues at home, only to find
   themselves frequently stuck in the facility’s system and unnecessarily
   hospitalized after so-called treatment has finished simply because DCFS
   has nowhere else to place them. Many of these young patients are
   low-income children with an already traumatic history of abuse and
   neglect, or drug and alcohol addictions.

   Since ProPublica’s report went live, and many victims have come forward
   to share personal attack stories, the American Civil Liberties Union of
   Illinois (ACLU) as well as several state lawmakers, became involved.
   The ACLU is threatening to take DCFS into court if the agency doesn’t
   take immediate action to ensure kids are safe by putting an immediate
   hold on future admissions to Chicago Lakeshore and transfer current
   patients to other treatment centers. Levin & Perconti applaud these
   many groups and lawmakers who have called for DCFS to conduct an
   independent investigation, as well as ProPublica for reporting the
   findings.

   These stories are beyond sensitive and reviewed with the most delicate
   appreciation of others’ feelings. No patient, especially a child,
   should endure this type of treatment and no one should get away with
   allowing it to continue one day further. Our team will unremittingly
   follow this investigation as it proceeds to unfold.

   The pastor of St. Mary's Catholic church in Swormville told
   parishioners Saturday morning that he was abused by a priest nearly 40
   years ago.

   The pastor, the Rev. Robert Zilliox, said in a letter to parishioners
   that he was interviewed by “60 Minutes” for a story that is slated to
   air on Sunday and also includes an interview with Siobhan O’Connor,
   Bishop Richard J. Malone’s former administrative assistant who was
   identified this week as the source of clergy sex abuse documents leaked
   to a local television station.

   Prior to his appointment in September as pastor of St. Mary's, Zilliox,
   who is a canon lawyer, served as a “canonical adviser” to Malone, a
   post that allowed him access to the diocese’s handling of allegations
   of abuse lodged against priests.

   “As the years have passed, I have become rather disillusioned with the
   results of my work and the frequent disregard for many of my canonical
   recommendations,” Zilliox said in his letter, which was emailed early
   Saturday morning to members of the parish. “I come to you today as your
   new pastor to inform you that after many hours, days and weeks of
   prayerful discernment I have decided to inform you that I, too, was a
   victim of abuse by a priest nearly 40 years ago when I was 13. It
   deeply pains me to share this but I feel it is vital for me to do so at
   this time.”

   Zilliox is the second Buffalo Diocese priest to announce publicly that
   he was a victim of clergy sex abuse.

   The 36 new Buffalo priests accused of sexually abusing children

   The Rev. Ryszard S. Biernat, who serves as Malone’s secretary, told a
   Town of Tonawanda congregation in September that he had been abused.
   Biernat did not name the priest in his remarks at St. John the Baptist
   Church. The News has learned that the priest was suspended from
   ministry and is not active in a parish.

   Biernat, 37, has told other people in the diocese that a veteran
   Buffalo priest sexually harassed and abused him when Biernat was in
   seminary studying for the priesthood.

   Zilliox also did not name the priest who he said abused him. Zilliox
   could not be reached Saturday for comment.

   Malone assigned Zilliox in September to St. Mary's to replace the Rev.
   Robert Yetter, who resigned as the longtime pastor after being accused
   of making unwanted sexual advances on two adult men, including one who
   said the priest tried to kiss him and grab his groin area.

   Documents leaked by O’Connor to WKBW-TV showed that Malone kept Yetter
   in ministry despite the allegations against the priest. The documents
   also showed that Malone allowed another priest, the Rev. Arthur Smith,
   to remain in ministry despite warnings from an elementary principal
   that Smith was trying to groom a child for abuse and displayed
   inappropriate behavior around a child.

   Many members of the parish were outraged by the revelations, which
   prompted Paul L. Snyder II, a parish deacon, to call for Malone’s
   resignation. Snyder also was interviewed for the episode by the CBS
   news magazine show. Malone declined to be interviewed.

   Zilliox said he agreed to do the interview with “60 Minutes” because he
   felt that he “could be silent no more” on the diocese’s handling of
   sexual abuse.

   “I only agreed to do so out of my love for our holy, good, divine and
   beautiful Church," he said in the letter. "Please know that I did not
   do this for recognition and it was the last thing I ever thought I
   would have to do as a priest. I have struggled for weeks over what to
   do, taking into consideration the fact as your pastor; I understood,
   that I cannot think of myself but also all of the 2800 families that
   make our parish special and unique."

   Zilliox said he prayed for weeks about what to do.

Alan Pergament: '60 Minutes' report on sex abuse allegations in Buffalo
Diocese is powerful

   If Buffalo's Bishop Richard J. Malone thought silence is the way to
   treat the prestigious CBS news magazine “60 Minutes,” he was sadly
   mistaken.

   The “60 Minutes” story Sunday about the alleged sexual abuse by priests
   in the Buffalo Diocese over decades was as powerful as could be and
   even more.

   CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker did a great job, calmly doing the
   interviews with whistleblower Siobhan O’Connor, Deacon Paul Snyder III
   and the Rev. Robert Zilliox.

   And the three people being interviewed were exceptional detailing their
   stories, their motivation for coming forward and the outrage that
   resulted from the revelations.

   Their stories were so powerful they practically demanded answers from
   the Buffalo bishop.

   By declining to be interviewed for the program, the bishop looked weak.
   His written statement explaining why he didn’t participate also showed
   that he needs to better understand journalism or be better served by
   someone advising him who does know journalism.

   In his statement to “60 Minutes,” the bishop emphasized recent policies
   aimed at responding to the past problems weren't going to be addressed
   by the program.

   He added in part: “It is clear to me and my staff that your roster of
   interviews did not include those who are aware of the full extent of
   the efforts of our Diocese to combat child abuse. Nor does it include
   those who urge me every day to stay the course and restore the
   confidence of our faithful.”

   He continued: “Finally, although I have respectfully declined your
   invitation, I have sat for hours of interviews with highly-regarded
   local journalists – a newscaster and a reporter for our daily paper –
   so that our message can be distributed locally.”

   In other words, Malone wanted a more balanced story about what is going
   on now when "60 Minutes” understandably was more interested in
   reporting about the horrors of past practices than putting a positive
   face on what is being done now.

   In the eyes of “60 Minutes,” Malone declined to be the balance he was
   looking for.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.cbsnews.com/video/whistleblower-says-buffalo-bishop-knew-of
   -sexual-abuse-allegations-but-did-nothing-60-minutes/

   His apparent view that sitting for hours with highly regarded local
   journalists was enough just didn’t cut it.

   While the “60 Minutes” piece included many of the details unveiled by
   WKBW-TV (Channel 7) reporter Charlie Specht and this newspaper, the TV
   program also included new information that could have and should have
   been addressed by the bishop.

   Malone should have been advised that facing an interview with a tough
   but fair national reporter could have gotten him more respect than the
   one he did last week with WIVB-TV (Channel 4) anchor Don Postles.

   That is especially true since after the eight-minute interview ended,
   Postles revealed that he is a member of the bishop’s Council of the
   Laity. That’s a journalistic conflict of interest even if Postles’
   heart was in the right place.

   I asked Channel 4 News Director Lisa Polster via a text when she became
   aware of Postles being on the committee. She hasn’t answered,
   suggesting she is aware the conflict looks bad even if Postles had
   looked tough.

   In the Channel 4 interview, Postles acted tough in his narration. His
   toughest moment came when he prefaced one of his questions this way:
   “As a father, I can’t imagine if any of my children were abused by a
   priest, the rage I could feel and the anger.”

   But overall, Postles acted tough while being much less than that. He
   didn’t follow up on some statements by the bishop that “60 Minutes”
   most likely would have addressed with him.

   That includes the bishop telling Postles that “with honesty and a
   totally clear conscience, Don, and to everyone else I have never, ever
   knowingly and intentionally left a priest in ministry that I knew had
   abused a child or moved him to another assignment or left them in the
   ministry ever.”

   Malone followed that by telling Postles that he tried to handle
   allegations against priests dealing with adults quietly “unless it was
   something really egregious.”

   I would have expected a “60 Minutes” reporter to ask the bishop to
   define “really egregious.” You would think all sexual abuse allegations
   are “really egregious.”

   The best way that Malone could have handled the difficult situation of
   being the focus of a “60 Minutes” report was to face a difficult
   cross-examination by Whitaker even if it meant some follow-up questions
   ignored by Postles.

   Of course, O’Connor, the pastor and the deacon would have been tough
   interviewees to follow because they all were so sincere and articulated
   their positions so well.

   A deeply religious former administrative assistant to the bishop,
   O’Connor’s piety and reasons for coming forward were admirable.

   O’Connor noted she was “most alarmed” at the handling of the Rev. Art
   Smith, who wasn't on the released list of 42 priests accused of sexual
   abuse allegations despite church records showing a complaint against
   him in 2013 by two young men and Smith being sent to counseling two
   years earlier “after repeated contact with an eighth-grade boy that
   included unwanted attention and Facebook messages.”

   “Our previous bishop had removed him from ministry, so I always thought
   it was odd that Bishop Malone had reinstated him when I explored his
   file more in depth, that might have really been the moment when I knew
   that I had to do something with this information,” O’Connor told
   Whitaker.

   In another chilling moment, O’Connor revealed that she was disturbed by
   the handling of the Rev. Fabian Maryanski, whose file included a 1980s
   accusation that he had sex with an underage girl. His absence from the
   list appeared to be a cover-up of a previous cover-up.

   When O’Connor read “we did not remove him from ministry despite full
   knowledge of the case, and so including him on list might require
   explanation,” she had a strong reaction.

   “And I remember thinking, if that’s their rationale for leaving a
   priest off, then how can I abide by this?” she told Whitaker.

   As impressive as O’Connor’s detailing of the alleged cover-up was, the
   most devastating sound bite came from Zilliox in an exchange with
   Whitaker after he told the reporter that several abuse allegations
   should have gone to Rome but didn’t.

   Whitaker: “How many of those priests should have been taken out of
   priesthood?”

   Zilliox: “I would argue at least eight or nine.”

   Whitaker: “How many of them still are in the priesthood here in
   Buffalo?”

   Zilliox: “All of them.”

   Whitaker: “All of them?”

   Zilliox: “All the guys that should have been removed from the
   priesthood are still priests.”

   Malone surely will be asked about that by local reporters this week –
   if he is willing to face them.

Two more Western New York priests put on leave after abuse complaints

   The current pastor and the immediate former pastor of a large parish in
   Clarence both have been suspended from ministry after the Diocese of
   Buffalo received complaints of abuse against them.

   The suspended priests are Monsignor Frederick D. Leising and the Rev.
   Ronald P. Sajdak.

   Sajdak is the current pastor of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary
   Church in Clarence. Leising was pastor of the parish prior to Sajdak.

   Leising, 73, also is former president and rector of Christ the King
   Seminary in Aurora.

   In May, Bishop Richard J. Malone suspended a third priest linked to
   Nativity — the Rev. Fabian J. Maryanski, who was retired and assisted
   with Masses at the parish.

   Leising’s name surfaced earlier this week on the Buffalo Diocese’s
   Facebook page. A woman who had accused Maryanski of repeatedly sexually
   abusing her when she was a teenager in the 1980s commented on a diocese
   posting of a statement asking anyone with a claim of suspected abuse to
   contact the diocese.

   “Perhaps you should revisit my letter to Bishop Malone (April 2018) and
   address the situation with Fr. Fred Leising,” wrote Stephanie McIntyre
   in her Facebook comment.

   McIntyre’s letter to Malone primarily described years of allegedly
   being sexually abused by Maryanski. But she also mentioned in the
   letter an uninvited advance by Leising in 1988, in which the priest
   allegedly grabbed her, forcibly kissed her and stuck his tongue in her
   mouth. McIntyre said she was 19 at the time.

   “It was disgusting and considering I was already being abused by
   Maryanski, it was kind of the final straw in my trusting of priests.
   When I told Maryanski and he just defended Leising's actions as being
   the norm, I was destroyed,” McIntyre said in an interview Saturday with
   The Buffalo News.

   Leising, who was vice rector of Christ the King Seminary in 1988,
   denied making the advance. He said he remembers the incident with the
   woman because it was so unusual, but he has a different recollection of
   it than McIntyre.

   "She grabbed me and spun me around and she kissed me and I was very
   shocked by that," he said. "I would never have directly attempted to do
   anything like that to anyone against their will."

   The diocese first brought McIntyre's complaint to Leising's attention
   months ago, he said. But it wasn't until Saturday morning that
   Auxiliary Bishop Edward Grosz informed Leising that he was being put on
   administrative leave due to that complaint.

   Leising said he is disappointed in the bishop's decision. He is
   scheduled to meet with Grosz in person Monday, he said. Leising was the
   second former seminary rector to be put on leave due to an abuse
   complaint. The bishop in September suspended the Rev. Joseph C. Gatto,
   who had been head of the seminary since 2015.

   Sajdak, 63, did not immediately return a voicemail Saturday seeking
   comment.

   Sajdak was accused of abuse dating back to the 1970s, prior to his
   being a priest, in a claim submitted to the Buffalo Diocese’s program
   to compensate victims of abuse. Sajdak was ordained as a Buffalo
   Diocese priest in 1996. He spent five years in the late 1970s and early
   1980s with the Discalced Carmelite Community in Boston, Mass., and
   attended Wadhams Hall Seminary College in Ogdensburg before that.

   The state’s child welfare agency Friday agreed to stop sending children
   in its care to a North Side psychiatric hospital where children have
   reported being sexually abused and assaulted, but said it would not
   seek the full independent investigation advocates had requested,
   setting up a possible court fight.

   The decision by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services
   came one day after state lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties
   Union of Illinois demanded the agency allow an outside expert to
   conduct a comprehensive investigation of Aurora Chicago Lakeshore
   Hospital in Uptown.

   The ACLU, which monitors DCFS as part of a federal court consent
   decree, also called on the agency to immediately stop sending children
   in its care to the hospital when they need psychiatric treatment.

   Those demands followed a ProPublica Illinois investigation that found
   numerous allegations of sexual abuse and assault of children, as well
   as regulatory violations related to patients’ health and safety.

   “What they’ve offered is inadequate,” ACLU spokesman Ed Yohnka said.
   “They want to limit the investigation only to the complaints that have
   been made. That doesn’t tell you anything about the systemic problems
   at the facility.”

   DCFS has investigated 16 allegations of abuse or neglect involving
   children at the hospital since January, according to records obtained
   by ProPublica Illinois. The agency said it found sufficient evidence to
   support four of the allegations and continues to investigate five,
   including claims from 7-year-old and 12-year-old girls who reported
   they were sexually abused by the same employee. The remaining seven
   allegations were not substantiated.

   Some of the children who alleged abuse should have been released from
   the hospital. They had been cleared for discharge but remained there
   because DCFS could not find them a place to go, ProPublica Illinois
   found.

   DCFS said the agency was taking steps in response to the ACLU’s
   request, including placing a hold on all admissions of children in DCFS
   care to the hospital as of Friday, continuing daily unannounced visits
   at the hospital and submitting reports detailing which DCFS children
   have been discharged from the hospital and where they were placed.
   Finding placement for children who have been at the hospital beyond
   what is deemed medically necessary “remains a top priority,” DCFS wrote
   in its response to the ACLU.

   EDITORIAL: For sake of abused children, investigate North Side hospital

   The review, DCFS said in a statement, “will make sure nothing was
   missed in our investigation process and assess whether those cases
   reflect any pattern or practice requiring correction for the protection
   of children.”

   The sticking point for the ACLU, according to Yohnka, was that the
   review would be limited to the 16 child abuse and neglect
   investigations. The organization wanted a full, independent
   investigation of Lakeshore.

   Yohnka said DCFS has asked to select the expert who would conduct the
   review. “I don’t think that’s independent,” he said.

   The ACLU had threatened to take DCFS to court next week if the agency
   failed to respond satisfactorily. In light of what DCFS has offered,
   going to court remains on the table, said Yohnka.

   DCFS officials told the ACLU that if “concerns about systemic issues at
   the hospital” emerge during the agency’s review, they will work with
   the Illinois Department of Public Health, which is investigating the
   hospital on behalf of federal regulators.

   “That is unacceptable in our view. She should be leading on this, not
   following,” ACLU general counsel Heidi Dalenberg said of DCFS Acting
   Director Beverly “B.J.” Walker.

   Federal officials said Lakeshore has until the end of the month to
   correct deficiencies or they will cut off its federal funding; hospital
   officials say that a loss of funding could force the hospital to close.

   The hospital has said it works to provide a safe and therapeutic
   environment for its patients and would cooperate with any
   investigation. It was confident a review would find it operates at the
   “highest standards.”

   State Sen. Julie Morrison, a Democrat from Deerfield, sent a letter to
   Walker on Friday asking for a third-party investigation of Lakeshore
   and its practices.

   That review, she wrote, should include children who reported abuse and
   neglect at the hospital.

   Walker quickly responded to Morrison, writing “I assure you that we at
   DCFS take the safety and wellbeing of our state’s children seriously”
   and that the issue has her “urgent attention.”

   “I want to believe that the agency is taking this seriously but anyone
   who has followed DCFS knows this isn’t a new problem,” Morrison said in
   a statement. “So I’m hoping that this investigation and its results and
   changes are as prompt and direct as the response I received from the
   director.”

   Three Chicago lawmakers made a similar demand on Thursday. They
   requested that an independent reviewer should be appointed to “evaluate
   not only the cases at Chicago Lakeshore and the response by DCFS, but
   also to conduct a thorough review of quality of care and adherence to
   all relevant laws, policies, and procedures.”

   The reviewer, they wrote in the letter, should develop recommendations
   on how to “guarantee the safety and best possible outcomes” for
   children at the hospital now or in the future.

   Gov. Bruce Rauner, who appointed Walker last year, is monitoring the
   situation at Lakeshore and considering “additional options to ensure
   the children who receive care there are safe,” a Rauner spokeswoman
   said.

   DCFS’ acting inspector general, Meryl Paniak, who first urged DCFS to
   undertake the review, said the agency’s response was insufficient.

   “That’s not what I was asking for,” she said Friday. “That’s not an
   independent review. I don’t know what they’re going to accomplish by
   reviewing investigations that were done. That’s what you should be
   doing anyway.”

   Paniak said she wants to a see a complete review of Lakeshore by
   someone who has expertise in psychiatric hospitals and child welfare
   and will be able to evaluate systemic issues.

   Charles Golbert, Cook County’s acting public guardian, said he, too,
   wants to see a broader, more holistic review. That inquiry, he said,
   would examine a range of issues, including improper use of powerful
   psychotropic medication, lax supervision and the hospital’s repeated
   failures to make security camera video available.

   “I want one comprehensive independent investigation,” he said, not
   various agencies “focusing on a narrow piece of the problem in a
   vacuum.”

Report: Washington foster kids abused at out-of-state group home

   by
     * Allegra Abramo

   InvestigateWest
   / October 17, 2018

   Because of a shortage of foster homes and group homes for children with
   behavioral and mental health challenges, Washington relies on
   out-of-state facilities like Clarinda Academy to house neglected and
   abused children removed from their parents. A new report from
   Disability Rights Washington claims that staff at the facility have
   been abusing some of those children. (Photo by Tina Pinedo/Disability

   Children entrusted to Washington’s foster-care system have endured
   “abusive” practices in a jail-like Iowa group home that inappropriately
   used painful physical restraints on children, according to a new
   report by a government-designated watchdog group.

   The report, released today by the nonprofit Disability Rights
   Washington, documents numerous instances in which youths between the
   ages of 14 and 16 were held down by three or more workers. One child’s
   glasses were broken when staffers pushed the youth to the floor, and
   another was restrained for 45 minutes.

   Washington social workers knew of the practices — some of which would
   not be allowed under Washington regulations — but failed to “ensure the
   rights and safety” of the teens, the report says. It focuses on the
   cases of three youths who were among about 20 Washington youths
   confined at the for-profit Clarinda Academy, which also houses juvenile
   delinquents, and a sister Iowa facility, Woodward Academy.

   “It hurt, I had bruises,” Kathie, 16, said of the restraint holds she
   says Clarinda staffers used on her a few times a week throughout her
   recent six-month stay at the facility. She spoke to InvestigateWest
   from a phone in her new group home in South Carolina and on the
   condition that this story use only her first name.

   The report points out that the state places young people in the custody
   of out-of-state group homes like Clarinda “without consent or due
   process,” circumventing protections against involuntary commitment.

   Youths’ case files obtained by Disability Rights show that Clarinda
   workers “use physical restraint for questionable reasons at best, and
   in some cases without justification,” the report says.

   Many of the youths in question would not have been sent out of state if
   not for Washington’s long-festering and desperate shortage of foster
   homes and group homes for youth with behavioral and mental health
   challenges. Washington increasingly relies on facilities spread across
   a dozen states to house neglected and abused children removed from
   their parents.

   Between 80 and 100 Washington children are now in out-of-state
   facilities. As those numbers have risen in recent years, attorneys and
   advocates for foster youth have sounded the alarm about the state’s
   ability to adequately monitor children in distant states, as
   InvestigateWest and Crosscut reported last month.

   The investigation released today by Disability Rights Washington, a
   group appointed under federal law to monitor the care of people with
   disabilities and mental illness, suggests those concerns are
   well-founded.

   In interviews with a dozen youths at Clarinda and Woodward in early
   2018, the organization heard consistent allegations of verbal and
   physical abuse. That prompted Disability Rights to launch an in-depth
   examination of three youths’ case files and internal Clarinda
   documents. Those records, it concludes, “demonstrate that Washington
   and Clarinda Academy are both failing to protect against the use of
   restraints for coercion and punishment for not following expectations.”

   Clarinda Academy management and a lawyer for the company did not
   respond to multiple phone calls and emails requesting comment.

   Washington sends dozens of foster youths to some of the other 29
   similar group homes owned by Clarinda’s parent company, Sequel Youth
   and Family Services. As of 2017, about three-quarters of Washington
   youth in out-of-state group homes were in Sequel facilities. The
   company also has plans to begin operating in Washington, according to
   Disability Rights.

   State officials said they took the report seriously and, based on a
   draft sent to the state in August, stopped sending kids to Clarinda and
   created plans for all children still there to find permanent homes or
   return to Washington by the end of next January. They have also
   dispatched state workers to check on all foster children in
   out-of-state facilities.

   For young people like Kathie with a history of childhood trauma, being
   physically restrained can cause further harm and worsening behavior,
   studies show. Yet treatment plans at Clarinda weren’t designed to
   effectively address youths’ traumatic history, according to Gauri Goel,
   a psychologist who interviewed the youths and reviewed their records as
   part of the Disability Rights inquiry. Instead, “the treatment they are
   receiving is likely to be ineffective and potentially
   counterproductive,” she wrote.

   A 2014 investigation of Clarinda by Disability Rights Iowa also found
   that the facility uses a “one-size-fits-all” approach to treatment and
   schooling, the Des Moines Register reported.

   Clarinda policy, as well as Iowa and Washington regulations, say youths
   should only be physically restrained when they present an imminent
   danger to themselves or others. But at Clarinda, residents who are
   being reprimanded are expected to stand completely still, and the
   report documents instances where the teens were restrained merely for
   moving an arm or hand.

   “Say that I was going to wipe my tears or cover my face because I’m
   crying,” Kathie told InvestigateWest. “Any sudden movements, I would
   end up getting restrained.”

   One teen was restrained for not obeying an order to stop scratching his
   legs, another for disrupting other residents in a dining area and
   refusing to leave.

   Youths showed Disability Rights how workers would “pull their elbows
   behind their backs and then force them to the ground by putting
   pressure on the backs of their knees,” the report says. Unlike
   Washington’s more stringent regulations around the use of restraints,
   Iowa’s do not prohibit pressure on joints, the chest or vital organs.

   Founded in 1992, Clarinda Academy was originally intended to be a
   facility for “delinquent” young men. Washington youth are sent there

   crime. (Photo by Tina Pinedo/Disability Rights Washington)

   Originally set up as a facility for “delinquent” young men, Clarinda
   Academy now houses up 266 young people ages 12 to 18. Its “typical
   student” is a juvenile offender, according to the parent company
   website.

   That helps explain why Clarinda is run “like a correctional
   institution,” according to Disability Rights, even though Washington
   youth are sent there through the foster care system, not because they
   have committed a crime. Clarinda sits across the street from a
   medium-security prison.

   The facility is tightly controlled. Boys and girls are strictly
   segregated, and in one case a youth was restrained for refusing to
   leave a hallway where children of the opposite gender were going to
   pass, the report says.

   The youths attend school on site, and they rarely leave. If they
   attempt to leave, staffers restrain them and bring them back.

   “For all practical purposes, they don’t have a choice to say, ‘I don’t
   think I need this level of treatment’ or ‘This program is not helping
   me.’ They don’t have that power,” said Disability Rights attorney Susan
   Kas, who made two trips to meet with youths at Clarinda.

   In Washington, young people age 13 and older have the right to leave an
   inpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment facility they
   entered voluntarily. State laws also protect them from continued
   involuntary treatment without a hearing.

   “Children in foster care do not lose these rights by virtue of having
   been removed from the care of their parents,” Lisa Kelly, a law
   professor at the University of Washington, wrote in an email. “They
   have the same rights as any other child in this state, and these rights
   are being ignored when they are essentially involuntarily committed to
   secure facilities that not only sit next to prisons but also possess
   many of the same restraints on their personal freedoms as prisons.”

   Beyond the potentially harmful treatment practiced at places like
   Clarinda, being cut off from family and other important adults in their
   lives is one of the most damaging consequences of out-of-state
   placements, advocates say.

   Isolation is a key danger. Phone calls home are limited to 10 to 20
   minutes per week.

   Washington provides financial help if family members want to visit
   foster youths sent out of state. But for children who are not connected
   to kin, the system rarely offers similar aid to family friends or
   others who might agree to take in the young person. Kathie said she
   didn’t receive a single in-person visit during her six months at
   Clarinda. As a result, connections with adults who might adopt or
   foster children upon their release tend to wither. “That was very
   devastating to the young people,” Kas said.

   To help kids get back into a family setting, rather than another
   institution, Kas said, it’s essential to support them in developing and
   maintaining those relationships.

   "There's a tendency to say, we don’t have enough group home beds here
   in Washington, so let’s get more group home beds, and then we can just
   shift everybody back to Washington,” Kas said. But discharging them to
   a family home, and hopefully a permanent one, “should be the goal of
   our system if we are going to do right by these kids.”

   Washington social workers also did not visit their charges in Clarinda,
   relying instead on reports from Iowa social workers. Even when they
   receive written reports from Iowa and Clarinda case workers about use
   of restraints, “Washington social workers do not follow up on
   allegations of abusive restraints,” Disability Rights found.

Foster parents abandoning troubled system

   Washington state lost nearly one in five foster homes between 2008 and
   2015 amid complaints of discord and disarray.

     * Susanna Ray

   / October 27

   The Department of Children, Youth and Families said in a statement that
   it will begin having case workers call out-of-state youths monthly and
   visit them quarterly.

   The department wrote that it “agrees with Disability Rights
   Washington’s main premise that children in out-of-home care are in
   general better off as close to home as possible, and that we should
   place all children in in-state facilities where possible.” However, it
   continued, “DCYF can’t cavalierly 'bring them home' without a plan to
   address each child’s individual needs and a placement option that is
   better than the placement they are in today.”

   Department secretary Ross Hunter called in his recent budget proposal
   for bringing all out-of-state Washington foster youth back within two
   years. Part of his plan involves shoring up capacity in Washington
   group homes, which have cut beds in recent years due in part to low
   reimbursement rates from the state.

   The department did not respond to a query from InvestigateWest about
   how much it pays Clarinda, but similar facilities in Washington are
   eligible to receive more than $12,000 per month. Sequel’s projected
   2017 revenue for all of its residential treatment centers was $161
   million, or more than $69,000 per bed, according to an investor
   presentation. A private equity firm acquired a majority stake in Sequel
   last year, citing “tremendous continued growth opportunities.”

   Over the past few months, the state has removed the three youths who
   were the focus of the Disability Rights Washington report from
   Clarinda, Kas said, but two remain in other group homes.

   Kathie, who has been in foster care since age 13, said her new group
   home is “just as terrible” as Clarinda, and that staffers there still
   physically restrain her.

   Yet, Kathie said, she’s doing better. She hasn’t harmed herself in
   almost two months. She dreams of returning to live with her best friend
   in Washington and to her school choir. She says she hopes to someday
   sing on America’s Got Talent.

   In the meantime, she would like the state will give kids like her
   another chance and bring them home. Keeping them out of state is
   “making us kids more and more stressed,” she said. “It doesn’t help
   anything at all.”

The alleged victim of New York’s Bishop John Jenik spoke at a Nov. 1 press
conference about his experiences with the bishop, which he said involved
years of sexual abuse.

   NEW YORK – The alleged victim of New York’s Bishop John Jenik spoke at
   a Nov. 1 press conference about his experiences with the bishop, which
   he said involved years of sexual abuse.

   Jenik, an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of New York, maintains
   his innocence.

   Michael Meenan, 52, said that Jenik cultivated an inappropriate
   relationship with him during the 1980s that involved dozens of trips
   upstate to Jenik’s country house, where he allegedly was groped while
   in bed with Jenik.

   “[Jenik] began taking me on and spending time with me as a means of
   cultivating a relationship that was immoral, inappropriate, and in some
   instances illegal,” Meenan said, calling it “the greatest evil I have
   witnessed in my lifetime.”

   Meenan, speaking to reporters outside St. Patrick’s Cathedral, said the
   abuse took place roughly between the ages of 13 and 17. He claimed
   Jenik, who was then pastor of a Bronx parish, targeted him because the
   priest knew that family issues at home made Meenan vulnerable.

   When asked why he chose to report the allegation after so many years,
   he said God told him in prayer that he should “tell the truth.”

   Meenan described himself as “an Ivy League graduate living on food
   stamps” and said his life is “in a ditch.”

   As a freelance journalist for the New York Times, Meenan said he
   occasionally wrote stories about clerical sexual abuse. He also said he
   would discourage fellow reporters from writing positive stories about
   Jenik’s work in the local community, adding that he had related his
   abuse experience in “informal conversations” with some reporters.

   “I am John Jenik’s worst nightmare,” he said. “And I’m here to tell you
   I’m not the only [victim]. There are others.”

   Meenan’s allegation was reviewed by the Lay Review Board of the
   Archdiocese of New York, which concluded “the evidence is sufficient to
   find the allegation credible and substantiated.”

   “Jenik did nothing to make sure that I grew up as a proud gay man,”
   Meenan stated.

   “He made sure to scramble my brain as much as possible with alcohol and
   immoral behavior, so I could not stand here today to tell you this
   story.”

   He said Jenik celebrated the marriage of his sister and baptised two of
   his nieces.

   This is Meenan’s second sex abuse case involving the Church; the first
   involved a religion teacher at Fordham Prep, who reportedly sexually
   assaulted him in 1984. The teacher, Fernand Beck, was dismissed in 2016
   after the school determined that Meenan’s allegation was “credible.”
   Meenan said Thursday that case is “pretty much handled.”

   The alleged victim is represented by Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney
   with experience representing Boston-area victims after the 2002 sexual
   abuse crisis. Garabedian also represented Meenan when he reported the
   Fordham Prep abuse in 2016.

   Meenan claimed that there are Catholic priests who are “attracted to
   young boys” and become priests in order to have access to children. He
   called Jenik “a disturbed person who is a danger to young boys.”

   He said Cardinal Timothy Dolan did the right thing by swiftly removing
   Jenik from ministry, while adding that in his view the cardinal has not
   yet done enough. He called for Dolan to work with the government of New
   York to pass new laws to hold perpetrators of abuse accountable.

   “There are guys in bad shape that need help,” he said. “God has given
   you the dignity that you deserve to live by…what are we doing with the
   Church’s money if we are not going out and rescuing people’s lives?”

   Jenik, who has served as pastor at Our Lady of Refuge parish since
   1985, wrote in an Oct. 29 letter to his parishioners that he continues
   “to steadfastly deny that I have ever abused anyone at any time.”

   The bishop asked parishioners to pray for the person who had accused
   him of abuse, and “for all those who are victim-survivors of abuse.”

   The case will be reviewed by the Vatican, most likely at the
   Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, sources say, before being
   passed to Pope Francis for judgment. Canon law establishes that only
   the pope may judge a penal matter involving a bishop, unless the pope
   delegates that responsibility elsewhere.

   Jenik is the first active bishop to be accused of abusing a minor since
   more than a dozen states including New York opened investigations this
   fall concerning sex abuse and cover-ups in the Catholic Church.

   Irish bishop: Abuse and cover-up will not be tolerated in Church

   Ossory.)

It took “far too long” for the Church to understand that both sexual abuse
and its cover-up “will no longer be tolerated,” according to the bishop
opening the annual conference of the National Board for Safeguarding Children
in the Catholic Church in Ireland.

   LEICESTER, United Kingdom – It took “far too long” for the Church to
   understand that both sexual abuse and its cover-up “will no longer be
   tolerated,” according to the bishop opening the annual conference of
   the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in
   Ireland.

   Bishop Dermot Farrell of Ossory said Oct. 26 that many people have felt
   “anger and dismay” after recent revelations about sexual abuse in the
   Catholic Church across the globe.

   Just before Pope Francis visited Ireland for the World Meeting of
   Families in August, the Church in the United States was hit with the
   double blow of the exposure of the years of sexual misconduct of former
   Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and the shocking details in a Pennsylvania
   grand jury report into clerical sexual abuse in six dioceses in that
   state. Since then, further reports were published in several European
   countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.

   “Despite the many reports and serious findings in this area here in
   Ireland in recent years, these reports from overseas were nonetheless
   dreadful. They have negatively affected many, many people, in
   particular victims and survivors of abuse, families and the community
   of faithful,” Farrell said.

   “It is still right, however, that the truth of these crimes would come
   to light, so that the abuse itself can be addressed and ultimately
   healed by a genuine response that is willing to go even deeper than the
   childhood terror inflicted on so many children,” the bishop continued.

   The National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in
   Ireland was founded in 2006, and has issued reports on sexual abuse in
   every diocese in Ireland as well as the country’s religious orders.

   The Oct. 26-27 conference in Kilkenny is its third national meeting,
   and has the theme ‘Be Not Afraid.’

   Farrell praised the “exemplary safeguarding standards and the clear
   mechanisms” of the board, saying they have allowed the Church to
   “respond vigorously” to sexual abuse complaints.

   “I want … to acknowledge the National Board’s contribution to
   addressing the grave issues, serious wrongs and tragic failures over
   the previous decades that have come to light in our land in and in our
   Church, as the scale and depth of the sexual abuse crisis in Ireland
   has been revealed,” Farrell said.

   “This terrible scandal has undermined the lives of many children and
   vulnerable people — young and not so young; it has eroded trust and
   good will and hangs like a cloud over all who seek to witness to the
   Good News,” he said.

   The bishop also praised the courage of abuse survivors, “who first
   brought the horrific truth of sexual abuse to light (and) must continue
   to be matched by our courage to listen to the survivors and, to respond
   in truth and in justice to all of them.”

   Farrell said the Catholic Church in Ireland “has been dismayed because
   of the devastating harm that has been done to children and for the way
   the leaders failed, for whatever reason, to respond, or responded very
   poorly, when in many instances there were grave indications that
   children had been abused.”

   He said if such reports had been acted upon in a timely manner, rather
   than denying or covering up the abuse and silencing victims to prevent
   scandal, it would have prevented others from being sexually abused.

   “We are now going through a period of rightful indignation, and
   necessary purification. It took far too long to arrive at a position
   where both sexual abuse of the most innocent in our communities and its
   cover-up in the Church will no longer be tolerated,” said the bishop.

   Katleho Sekhotho | 66 days ago

   JOHANNESBURG - Anti-abuse groups in support of the Parktown Boys who
   were sexually abused by convicted offender Collan Rex say greater work
   needs to be done at schools to prevent such crimes.

   Earlier this week, the case against the former water polo assistant
   coach from Parktown Boys High School was postponed to later this month.

   Rex has been convicted of 144 counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of
   common assault.

   Several parents and anti-abuse groups say there isn't enough education
   on body safety in schools and how children should report sexual abuse
   crimes.

   Koleinu South Africa's director Rozanne Sack says in most cases
   children aren't given the opportunity to speak up.

   “There needs to be more education on reporting protocol with child
   abuse cases.”

   She says she hopes justice will prevail in this case.

   “We are proud of the boys and we are here for them.”

   Sentencing has been scheduled for 27 November.

Accusations Of Abuse And Neglect of Don Meredith’s Daughter At Center Of
Court Battle

     * Bridgett Howard
     * 4:55 pm
     * November 2, 2018

   (LEX 18/ Courier Journal)–Late football legend Don Meredith wanted his
   mentally challenged daughter to stay in the care of the Stewart Home in
   Frankfort, but some relatives have claimed that her stepmother
   underfunded the daughter’s trust, which led to a court battle over
   allegations of abuse and neglect.

   Heather Meredith, 49, is the football star’s youngest child. She has
   lived at the Stewart Home for years and it is where her father wanted
   her to stay. He set up a trust to cover the necessary expenses, but
   when Don Meredith died in 2010, Heather’s stepmother took over
   guardianship and control of her trust.

   In hundreds of documents, collected during an investigation by the
   Franklin County Sheriff’s Department, it is alleged, by Heather’s
   biological mother, that social workers stated Heather was abused and
   neglected by not having enough money in her trust to cover the
   necessary expenses. It also states that Heather’s biological mother
   believes Heather’s welfare suffered because of her stepmother, who
   controlled the trust. A state social worker reported that Heather’s
   teeth were not fixed for seven years and she went on to write that her
   guardian “failed to protect her financial interest and medical issues.”

   The allegations were later unsubstantiated.

   “The bottom line for me was always that I was concerned whether or not
   the trust was properly funded and this girl’s, woman’s needs were met,”
   said Franklin County Commonwealth’s Attorney Larry Cleveland. “Those
   photos, that information was troubling.”

   Cleveland was asked to prosecute the case, but says that it was
   ultimately settled. Heather’s biological mother took over guardianship
   and her stepmother put more money into the trust so Heather’s needs are
   funded for a lifetime.

   The allegations of abuse and neglect were never handled criminally.

   “I thought that if I took my case to a grand jury, I’d probably get an
   indictment, let’s put it that way,” said Cleveland.

   A family spokesperson for Heather Meredith’s biological family sent LEX
   18 a statement, “While we are disappointed that such a private and
   sensitive family matter has been made public, we take comfort knowing
   that Heather, the most important party in this situation, is now safe
   and happy.”

 ‘You try to forget’: Man remembers alleged abuse at St. Joseph’s Oratory

   Pierre-Yves Asselin joined the children’s choir when he was 8 years
   old. The abuse, he says, started early and lasted years.

   Jesse Feith, Montreal Gazette
   Updated: November 1, 2018

   "It's the kind of thing you try to forget," 68-year-old Pierre-Yves
   Asselin said. "But it always comes back to you." John Mahoney /
   Montreal Gazette

   Warning: This story contains explicit content.

   A week before the Supreme Court of Canada is set to hear arguments over
   whether Montreal’s St. Joseph’s Oratory should be included in a sexual
   assault class action suit, one alleged victim is speaking out for the
   first time about the abuse he remembers suffering at the iconic
   institution.

   Pierre-Yves Asselin, now 68, says he was repeatedly sexually abused —
   between the ages of 8 and 17 — at the hands of oratory staff and
   members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.

   “It’s the kind of thing you try to forget. That you try to not think
   about,” Asselin said from his Verdun apartment Wednesday. “But it
   always comes back to you.”

   Asselin has never spoken to anyone about the abuse he suffered,
   including his family. He says he first thought of opening up about it
   after hearing of the congregation’s settlement with victims in 2013,
   but hesitated to do so.

   Hearing more and more about Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals — and
   the more recent movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault —
   convinced him he needed to speak out.

   From a young age, Asselin knew he wanted to be a musician. His father
   played the cello and violin professionally and was the music director
   at several chapels around Montreal. So joining the St. Joseph’s Oratory
   children’s choir when he was 8 seemed like a perfect fit.

   But the abuse, Asselin says, started early and lasted years. The
   memories have always gnawed at him. Some are vague, others vivid.

   He says the first incidents came when he was 8 or 9, while showering at
   the oratory’s on-site dormitory for children. Two female instructors
   would often enter the shower and insist on scrubbing him down. He knew
   it wasn’t right, he says, but was more confused than anything.

   Then, a bit later, he remembers being brought down to the basement of
   what was called Manoir One on the oratory’s grounds, where he says a
   Holy Cross brother sexually abused him for the first time.

   He recalls the feeling of the man’s rough beard against his face, him
   forcing his tongue into his mouth, and feeling the brother’s erect
   penis against his stomach as he pushed against him.

   “That happened two or three times,” Asselin said, “and then one day he
   disappeared.”

   At 11 or 12, Asselin says, a Holy Cross father called him into an
   upstairs parlour at an on-site residence. The father acted as a sort of
   guidance counsellor to the children, Asselin said, and they were
   encouraged to confess to him. But once alone in the room with him,
   Asselin was asked to take his pants off so the father could inspect
   him, he says.

   “He said, ‘Maybe we need to make sure you’re in good health and
   everything is OK.’”

   But to Asselin, who aspired to play the organ from the moment the
   oratory installed its Grand Beckerath Organ in 1960, some of the worst
   kinds of abuse came from a man he admired the most: the lead organist
   at the oratory, who took him under his wing as a student.

   Sitting on the bench with their backs to the organ, Asselin says, the
   organist would often rub his thighs or take Asselin’s hand and place it
   on his own thighs.

   The abuse, he says, continued in different forms for years.

   “I didn’t want to stop him, because I didn’t want to lose access to the
   organ. That’s what I feared,” he said. “It always happened at the
   oratory, or at his house, and he was an employee of the oratory.”

   While spending the night at the man’s house when he was 17, Asselin
   says the man forced himself on him and tried to get him into bed.
   Asselin refused, and it was the last time the man tried to abuse him.

   Asselin would go on to enjoy a successful organist career of his own,
   working internationally from 1975 to 1995, but he says the abuse never
   left him. He’s often wondered if he was the only one to suffer what he
   remembers going through or if he was simply too young to realize it was
   happening to others around him.

   He’s also thought about trying to forget it all, to somehow repress the
   memories and move on. But he hopes sharing his story instead could help
   others.

   “Will it change anything? I don’t know,” he said. “But there are more
   chances of making a difference by speaking out than by not.”

   According to Sébastien Richard, an abuse survivor and spokesperson for
   church abuse victims in Quebec, Asselin’s experience — and his decision
   to speak about it so many years later — is typical for many victims.

   “Like it or not, it always stays with you. You can’t act like it didn’t
   happen,” he said. “You can put it away, put it to the side, but
   inevitably there’s an event that will happen that will make it come
   back up.”

   In 2013, the Congregation of Holy Cross apologized and paid up to $18
   million to compensate 206 victims for abuse that occurred at three
   Quebec institutions. The class action suit did not include St. Joseph’s
   Oratory.

   A second class action, which named the oratory along with other Holy
   Cross institutions, was launched when roughly 40 more alleged victims
   came forward after hearing other men share their stories through the
   lawsuit. The oratory was included in the suit amid allegations that
   some of the abuse occurred there.

   The suit was first rejected by Quebec Superior Court in 2015, but then
   allowed to move forward by the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Supreme
   Court of Canada accepted to hear the oratory’s appeal earlier this
   year.

   To Richard, who will be travelling to Ottawa for next Wednesday’s
   hearings, the case, among other things, is “a question of access to
   justice.”

   He said the average age of those wanting to participate in the suit is

   Ugandan scholar and activist Stella Nyanzi has been arrested following
   allegations she abused President Yoweri Museveni and his deceased
   mother.

   Controversial Ugandan scholar and activist Stella Nyanzi has been
   arrested.

   According to the Daily Monitor, detectives from the Directorate of
   Criminal Investigations headquarters pounced on Ms Nyanzi following
   allegations she abused President Yoweri Museveni and his deceased
   mother.

   Nyanzi was arrested at a time she was holding a silent strike at
   Makerere University in Kampala.

   She opted for the strike after the institution’s management failed to
   restore her office space despite a court ruling.

   “We have her and detectives are yet to interrogate her,” said DCI
   Spokesperson Vincent Ssekatte.

   It is alleged that Nyanzi abused President Museveni and his deceased
   mother on September 16 on her Facebook page, with Ssekatte describing
   the offence as cyber harassment and offensive communication.

   If found guilty, Nyanzi could face a fine of upto UGS480,000 (about
   Ksh12,000) or a year in jail, or both.

   This is the second time police are arresting Nyanzi on allegations of
   abusing President Museveni and his family.

   In April 2017, Nyanzi was picked from Mackinon Suites Hotel in Kampala
   where she was speaking to Rotarians about fundraising money for
   sanitary pads for school girls, and charged with two counts including
   cyber harassment and offensive communication. She is still battling the
   charges.

   The Canadian Air Force is examining whether the drunk VIPs who harassed
   a military flight crew last year on a morale tour should apologize,
   according to documents obtained by Postmedia.

   Some of the VIPs on the taxpayer-funded Canadian Forces tour were
   abusive but the military flight crew trying to deal with them felt they
   had no choice but endure the behaviour as the individuals were guests
   of Canada’s top soldier, Gen. Jon Vance, a recently released military
   investigation found.

   The civilian passengers were exempt from security screening because
   they were VIPs and some — already drunk — walked on to the Canadian
   Forces aircraft with alcoholic drinks in their hands.

   The December 2017 VIP trip to Greece and Latvia, which cost taxpayers
   $337,000, resulted in a sex assault charge earlier this year against
   former NHL player Dave “Tiger” Williams and a public relations black
   eye for the Forces.

   The trip, planned by Vance’s office, has been dubbed the “party” flight
   by some military personnel because of what unfolded on the RCAF Polaris
   aircraft. Video from the flight shows people with their drinks —
   including one of Vance’s staff — dancing in the aisles of the aircraft
   as a rock band plays at the back of the plane. Others chewed tobacco,
   in violation of Canadian Forces rules, spitting the slimy juice into
   cups, according to the investigation. There were allegations two
   individuals were so drunk they urinated themselves.

       military ‘party flight,’ probe finds
     * Controversial Canadian military VIP ‘party flight’ cost taxpayers
       more than $337K
     * Photos suggest partying on past military VIP junkets not a one-time
       incident as top general claims

   Air Force brass had a good idea of some of what happened just days
   after the flight and on Dec. 12, 2017 launched a crackdown on how
   alcohol was to be served on such VIP excursions, the newly released
   records obtained by Postmedia indicate. Then RCAF commander Lt.-Gen.
   Michael Hood ordered the commander of 1 Canadian Air Division to not
   only further investigate the allegations but examine “whether an
   acceptable form of restitution was possible to include a formal
   apology, if warranted and acceptable to those involved.”

   The Canadian Forces did not provide comment on whether the crew will
   receive an apology.

   But the behaviour of some VIPs was so out of control that a February
   2018 RCAF investigation concluded the safety of the flight was
   compromised.  “The state of some of the passengers could have
   compromised the safety of the crew and other passengers in an emergency
   situation,” noted Col. Mark Goulden, commander of 8 Wing.

   The Canadian Forces has not provided information on the VIPs on the
   aircraft or which ones were inebriated.

   Initial details of the “alleged sexual harassment and touching” on the
   aircraft were transmitted to dozens of RCAF senior staff on Dec. 6,
   2017. There was concern within the Forces that the news media might
   find out about what happened, according to the documents obtained under
   the Access to Information law.
   [tiger-williams-1.png?w=640] Years before the 2017 âparty flightâ
   that led to sexual assault and assault charges against him, former NHL
   player Dave âTigerâ Williams, left, is seen on a 2010 military
   morale tour to Afghanistan with what appear to be beads stuck up his
   nose. thecarpetfrogs.com

   Military police charged Williams on Feb. 7 with sexual assault as well
   as assault but few details were released about the events on the plane.
   The alleged victim is a female military flight attendant. Williams has
   denied any wrongdoing.

   Vance indicated on Dec. 6 that he knew about the role excessive alcohol
   played on the flight, the documents noted.

   On Feb. 13, 2018, Chris Henderson, the Defence Department’s assistant
   deputy minister of public affairs, updated Vance and Deputy Minister
   Jody Thomas about the answers he was going to supply Postmedia,
   according to the documents. Those included the claim that “on this
   particular flight, like on commercial flights, alcohol was permitted
   and served to Team Canada guests.”

   But Henderson’s claim flies in the face of what was already known by
   the military leadership as well as the Air Force investigation. Besides
   boarding the aircraft drunk, with open alcoholic beverages, the VIPs
   had a cooler full of booze set up on the plane, where they were able to
   serve themselves. The alcohol was authorized by Vance and paid for by
   his staff.

   In addition, in the statement provided to Postmedia, Henderson also
   claimed that the “average cost of such a visit is $15,000.”

   Postmedia later compiled figures showing the flight cost taxpayers more
   than $337,000.

Huddersfield grooming gang: Victim says there are more girls being abused

   One of the victims of a grooming gang jailed for abusing 15 girls
   believes there are more young people yet to speak out.

   Speaking anonymously to Sky News, the woman - who was abused between
   the ages of 13 and 18 - shared her story and urged others to "get
   justice for themselves".

   The call comes after sixteen men were jailed for a total of 221 years
   as part of the grooming gang who abused 15 girls in and around
   Huddersfield between 2004 and 2011.

   Four more men were found guilty and are waiting to be sentenced for
   offences such as rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation.

   The victim said she became "friends" with the men at first before the
   abuse started.

   "They used to buy you gifts, give you cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis,"
   she said. "And then I was in a relationship with one of them, and then
   it's like you start getting passed around to their friends and stuff.

   "Some days you're waking up and you don't even know how you've ended up
   in certain places.

   "You can't remember what happened to you. It was just a circle."

   She said she was taking drugs, getting her drinks spiked and was
   "constantly getting beaten up". She said it was "all a bit of a haze".

   It was years before she spoke out about her ordeal.

   She said she thought there were "loads of victims out there that need
   to come forward and get justice for themselves".

   The woman said she believed abuse was still going on in Huddersfield.

   "The men, they range from various ages. I think the oldest was 54 and
   the youngest was in his 20s," she said. "And it's like the older ones
   pass it down to the younger generation.

   "History will just keep on repeating itself."

   She added: "I hope that the results that we've got gives them to
   courage to come forward and speak up and get the justice they deserve."

   The woman's mother told Sky News she wanted to see better awareness of
   grooming and how it can manifest.

   "As a parent, with a 13-year-old, if you notice a change in their
   behaviour, any change - don't be afraid, don't be afraid to ask them
   why," she said.

   "Don't be afraid to say to them 'look - are you being groomed?'

   "Explain what it is because that is the only way we're going to stop
   this - we have to make them aware."

   She said the victims had been "failed by all the authorities in
   question".

   "They do need more safeguarding training, they need more awareness
   around it," she said. "[They need to know] not to be afraid, for them
   to speak out and not to be afraid of arresting somebody and saying
   'look, we think this is going on'."

   The convictions have spurred new debate around grooming gangs with all
   of the men being of south Asian heritage and predominantly Pakistani
   backgrounds.

   Commenting on the case, Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: "These sick
   Asian paedophiles are finally facing justice. I want to commend the
   bravery of the victims. For too long, they were ignored. Not on my
   watch. There will be no no-go areas."

   Labour MP David Lammy denounced Mr Javid's remarks and replied: "Shame
   on you @sajidjavid. Words have consequences and your pandering to the
   far right increases the risk of violence against British Asians."

   Local mosque leaders have since spoken out to strongly condemn the
   "monstrous" crimes.

North Korea rejects sexual abuse report and calls alleged victims 'human
scum'

   Human Rights Watch found "growing evidence" to suggest sexual abuse
   against women was endemic in North Korea.

   By Sanya Burgess, news reporter

   North Korea says a report containing allegations of widespread sexual
   abuse of women in the country is "an extremely dangerous provocation".

   Human Rights Watch (HRW) interviewed more than 50 North Koreans who
   fled the country in the last seven years and published their findings
   earlier this week.

   The women said they suffered rape, assault, sexual harassment, verbal
   abuse and intimidation at the hands of North Korean police and other
   officials.

   One woman said it was so commonplace she did not think being abused was
   unusual.

   Responding to the report, North Korea's association for human rights
   studies branded the women interviewed as "human scum".

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBzrIvh_kWE

   The association called the report "preposterous" and claimed it was "a
   part of [a] political scheme fabricated by the hostile forces ... to
   tarnish the image of the DPRK", the country's official acronym,
   according to the state Korean Central News Agency.

   "It is also an extremely dangerous provocation aimed at reversing the
   tide of peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula," the statement
   said.

   The 86-page report concludes that unwanted sexual contact and violence
   is so common in North Korea it has come to be accepted as part of
   ordinary life.

   It reads: "While sexual and gender-based violence is of concern
   everywhere, growing evidence suggests it is endemic in North Korea."

   The US-based rights group's report included testimony from an anonymous
   former textile trader in her 40s, who recounted being treated like a
   sex toy "at the mercy of men".

   "On the days they felt like it, market guards or police officials could
   ask me to follow them to an empty room outside the market, or some
   other place they'd pick," where they forced sexual encounters, she
   said.

   "It happens so often nobody thinks it is a big deal. We don't even
   realise when we are upset," she added.

   Another trader said: "They consider us [sex] toys. We [women] are at
   the mercy of men."

   She continued: "Sometimes, out of nowhere, you cry at night and don’t
   know why."

   Those interviewed all left the country after 2011, when the current
   leader, Kim Jong Un, rose to power.

   In a summary of the report, HRW said: "The government fails to
   investigate and prosecute complaints, or to provide protection and
   services to victims, and even asserts that the country is implausibly
   free of sexism or sexual violence."

   "Sexual violence in North Korea is an open, unaddressed, and widely
   tolerated secret," said HRW executive director Kenneth Roth.

Why teens keep the secret of sexual abuse

   Street Roots

   Child-abuse prevention shouldn't be the responsibility of victims who
   feel powerless, experts say

   by Libby Dowsett | 2 Nov 2018

   “I didn’t know it was wrong until another man did it.”

   As a young girl, Connie Ferris (name has been changed to protect her
   identity) didn’t realize her father’s strange touches and secret talks
   about the birds and the bees were anything unusual, until she was
   sexually abused by her boss when she was 15 years old.

   Her employer owned a popular small-town convenience store and was more
   than friendly to Connie. He bought her a cashmere sweater and an
   extra-small T-shirt, both of which Connie said fit a little too snugly.
   She said he took pictures of her wearing them. He also brought her an
   Appaloosa horse. Along with the gifts, Connie said, there were
   inappropriate hugs, pinches and comments.

   One night, Connie’s boss told her parents that he would drive the teen
   home after her shift. Connie said she had to sit close to him in his
   pickup because there was a big box on the floorboard. She said that
   once he pulled into her long driveway, he stopped his truck and
   sexually assaulted her. Connie said he told her not to tell anyone
   because no one would believe her.

   “At that moment in my life, I just didn’t want to live anymore,” said
   Connie. “I knew my parents weren’t going to believe me.”

   “I mean, this man…everyone loved this man,” she said.

   In desperation, Connie said, she swallowed a bunch of aspirin that
   night from her family’s medicine cabinet. When her mother noticed
   something was wrong, she told her about the assault.

   Connie said her mother told her to go to bed and assured her they would
   tell Connie’s father and the police the next day, after their house
   guests went home. Connie still hadn’t connected the dots between what
   was happening with her father and what had happened with her boss.

   The next day, her parents didn’t call police.

   Connie said her father simply told her to go back to the store, thank
   her boss for everything he had done for her and resign.

   “It made me feel terrible, like we were hiding it,” said Connie. “I was
   told if I talked to anyone, I would be homeless.”

   Connie was alone with her secret.

   Sexual assault remains the most underreported crime for teens and
   adults, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
   Nearly 70 percent of all reported sexual assaults happen to children
   age 17 and younger, according to Darkness to Light, a national child
   sexual abuse prevention program.

   The National Child Traumatic Stress Network says teens may drop hints
   to find out if the response will be supportive. If they feel supported,
   they may choose to share more information over time.

   Sue Lewis, a licensed clinical social worker and forensic interviewer
   supervisor for the Children’s Center of Clackamas County, says there
   are many barriers that keep teens from disclosing abuse.

   “They are afraid to tell because they fear it can’t be proved,” said
   Lewis. “They worry they won’t be taken seriously.

   “They may blame themselves or think they will be blamed. If they were
   drinking, they might feel it was somehow their fault.”

   Lewis has more than 20 years of experience as forensic interviewer in
   the field of child abuse. As a supervisor, she helps train other
   interviewers in the technique of talking to young people in a
   child-friendly, neutral manner in order to learn about their experience
   in a forensically sound manner.

   She said the child gets to decide what they want to talk about and
   tells their story without the listener tainting their recollection with
   assumptions or judgment.

   “We try to ask questions in the most open-ended manner,” Lewis said.
   “Tell me why you’re here today? Tell me what happened?”

   The interviewer has already informed the child that their disclosure is
   being digitally recorded by a discreet camera. The child is also shown
   that law enforcement and representatives from the Department of Human
   Services are watching from the next room through a one-way window.

   “We don’t keep any secrets,” said Lewis. “We ask them to be honest, so
   we are honest with them.”

   Lewis says one of the main goals is to minimize the number of times the
   child needs to be interviewed.

   “Research tells us, by having them tell their story over and over, they
   begin to feel like they’re not being believed,” said Lewis. “They can
   shut down, saying, ‘You know what, this didn’t happen.’ They recant.”

   By the time a teenager gets to the Children’s Center, Lewis said, they
   typically are ready to talk about what happened, but they may have
   faced many challenges to get to that point. Lewis said teen girls often
   first talk about the abuse with their friends, rather than their
   parents. Then, those friends might keep the secret, not wanting to
   violate their friend’s trust.

   Lewis said teenage boys face different barriers. The sexuality piece is
   a big concern, with many boys worrying about a stigma of being presumed
   gay.

   “It actually might have felt good physically, yet it doesn’t feel good
   in their head and their heart,” said Lewis. They might feel responsible
   for the way their body reacted to the abuse.

   Similar to Connie’s situation, many children might not realize that
   they are being abused. Or, teenagers may say they didn’t realize it was
   a big deal. Some don’t understand the seriousness of the situation,
   Lewis said.

   Another reason for not telling is a desire to protect their mothers. A
   daughter sees that her mother loves her boyfriend, and she doesn’t want
   to cause a problem between them.

   “Many of the barriers have to do with fear,” said Lewis. “Fear of the
   consequences, fear of the offender. Will they be removed from their
   family? Will someone be taken to jail?”

   There is also the concern among teens and younger children for their
   physical health. Those who come into the Children’s Center are offered
   a non-invasive medical exam with the center’s specially trained staff.
   Lewis said many teens are reluctant and always have the choice to
   decline the exam. But, she said, it is a good way to assure children
   that everything is OK with their bodies.

   For Connie, her abuse affected her self-esteem, leading to weight
   issues throughout her teen and adult years. She began wearing big
   clothes to prevent men from looking at her. When she began to get in
   shape and feel good about herself, she shut down again when a man would
   offer a compliment.

   Her relationship with her mother also deteriorated.

   “I just wanted her to believe me,” said Connie. “But she never said she
   believed me, even as an adult.”

   Connie finally decided to share her secret nearly four decades after
   her abuse began. She and her family returned to her hometown to attend
   Connie’s 30-year class reunion. As she drove by her old house with her
   husband and children, the one question that had been on Connie’s mind
   since the age of 15 finally needed to be answered.

   “I thought, what if I tell my story and it helps one person?” Connie
   asked herself.

   She enrolled in the Darkness to Light child abuse prevention training
   course, which she had heard about during a work luncheon. It turned out
   to be her catalyst for change. During that first training, she realized
   she wasn’t the only one needing support: Her brother had recently
   confided in her that his daughter had accused him of sexual abuse,
   which he denied.

   “I realized, oh my God, we’re going to go through this again,” said
   Connie.

   Connie knew how important it was to tell her niece that the teen would
   be supported and believed. Connie told her niece’s mother that she was
   available to answer any questions her niece might have. She even helped
   her niece pursue charges – something that never happened in Connie’s
   case – by enlisting the help of the Children’s Advocacy Center.

   Weeks after taking that initial Darkness to Light training course,
   Connie said, her brother was arrested on charges of abuse of six
   people, some children, including his daughter. He eventually struck a
   plea deal with the court.

   Empowered, Connie decided it was time to put her story down in writing
   and share it with more people – 300 more people, in fact. She agreed to
   read it during the Children’s Advocacy Center annual luncheon. The room
   – filled with law enforcement officers, business people and elected
   officials – fell silent as she finally decided to tell her truth.

   “I felt like this black cloud I’d been carrying with me all these years
   was gone,” Connie said. “I just felt lighter.”

   Connie said organizations, including the Children’s Center and the
   Children’s Advocacy Center, are the key to helping communities learn
   about child abuse prevention. The centers also offer survivors
   invaluable resources for health and healing.

   Lewis agreed there needs to be a shift in society to stop putting the
   responsibility of preventing child abuse on the victim, who may feel
   powerless, especially if their offender is an authority figure.

   “We parents need to tell children there are bad people, people with
   touching problems,” suggested Lewis. “If someone is making you feel
   uncomfortable, you need to come tell me, and I will deal with them.”

   The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) recommends parents
   talk openly with their children about sexuality, boundaries and
   consent, and inform teens that they can talk to you about difficult
   situations and you will be available to help them, even when they break
   a rule.

   Lewis said teen brains are still developing, so teenagers are going to
   practice poor judgment at times. Parents shouldn’t blame them for it.

   The NCTSN and Lewis both recommend the Darkness to Light program to
   educate yourself about child abuse. Check out its website or get more
   information on group trainings, similar to the course Connie attended,
   through the Clackamas County Children’s Center.

   A woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault has
   confessed to federal authorities that she made up the claims because
   she was 'angry' and she wanted to hurt his political career.

   Senator Chuck Grassley referred the false accuser, Judy Munro-Leighton,
   to the Justice Department for investigation on Friday, after she
   admitted she 'just wanted to get attention' on Thursday.

   Now it's in the hands of the Department of Justice to investigate her
   for potentially making 'materially false statements' and for
   'obstruction'.

   On September 19 Senator Kamala Harris received a letter signed Jane
   Doe, describing with graphic detail how Kavanaugh and a friend had
   supposedly raped her several times in the backseat of a car, but did
   not mention when or where.

   Judge Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed onto the Supreme Court on October 6
   despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, including by Christine
   Blasey Ford who spoke before the Committee

   Judge Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed onto the Supreme Court on October 6
   after undergoing public scrutiny as multiple women came forward to
   accuse him of sexual assault. Christine Blasey Ford led the forefront
   and testified before Senate Judiciary Committee to detail how she was
   raped back in the summer of 1982.

   Senator Harris forwarded the Jane Doe letter to Committee
   investigators.

   On September 26 the Committee questioned Kavanaugh and read out the
   letter to him. He responded saying: 'The whole thing is ridiculous.
   Nothing ever -- anything like that...The whole thing is just a crock,
   farce, wrong, didn't happen, not anything close.'

   Later that day the Committee publicly released the transcript of the
   interview as well as the full Jane Doe letter.

   Then Munro-Leighton emailed the Committee staff days later on October 3
   with the subject line: 'I am Jane Doe from Oceanside CA -- Kavanaugh
   raped me', identifying herself as the letter's author.

   'I refuse to allow Donald J. Trump to use me or my story as an ugly
   chant at one of his Republican rallies. I know that Jane Doe will get
   no media attention, but I am deathly afraid of revealing any
   information about myself of my family,' she said in the e-mail.

   'I watched in horror as Trump vilified Dr. Blasey-Ford. I will not
   allow this abuse to be directed toward me,' she added.

   In her e-mail she referred to her earlier letter sent to Senator Harris
   and even included a typed version.

   Senate investigators tracked her down and interviewed her. Although she
   signed her letter as 'Jane Doe of Oceanside, California' she was found
   in Kentucky.

   Investigators finally got a hold of her on November 1 by phone and
   spoke with her about the allegations.

   Under questioning however she admitted she was never sexually assaulted
   by Kavanaugh and said she was not the author of the original 'Jane Doe'
   letter.

   When investigators asked if she was the 'Jane Doe' from Oceanside,
   California who wrote to Senator Harris she said: 'No, no, no. I did
   that as a way to grab attention. I am not Jane Doe...but I did read
   Jane Doe's letter. I read the transcript of the call to your
   Committee...I saw it online. It was news.'

   She fessed that she 'just wanted to get attention' and that it was a
   'tactic' and ploy'.

   When asked about the e-mail she said: 'I was angry, and I sent it out'.

   Investigators asked her if she ever met Judge Kavanaugh to which she
   replied 'Oh Lord, no'.

   In a phone conversation with the committee she said she 'just wanted
   attention' adding that she called the Congress multiple times to oppose
   Kavanaugh's nomination during his hearing process

   Grassley described Munro-Leighton as a left-wing activist who was
   'decades older than Judge Kavanaugh' and referred her to be
   investigated by the DOJ and FBI.

   While there is a chance Munro-Leighton could have been the original
   Jane Doe author, it is also possibly she saw the letter's transcript
   online then took credit for it and e-mailed the Committee claiming to
   be the author.

   'The Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant
   information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent
   sure about what they know. But when individuals intentionally mislead
   the Committee, they divert Committee resources during time-sensitive
   investigations and materially impede our work,' Grassley said.

   'Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal. It is
   illegal to make materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements
   to Congressional investigators. It is illegal to obstruct Committee
   investigations,' he added.

Judy Munro-Leighton's email to Committee staff

   To all Republican Senators, 10/3/18

   My name is Jane Doe, from Oceanside CA. I am sharing with you the story
   of the night that Brett Kavanaugh and his friend sexually assaulted and
   raped me in his car. Here is the letter that I sent to Sen. Kamala
   Harris on Sept. 19 with details of this vicious assault. The Senate
   Judiciary Comm had a phone interview on Sept. 26 with Kavanaugh to ask
   him about my letter.

   I refuse to allow Donald J. Trump to use me or my story as an ugly
   chant at one of his Republican rallies. I know that Jane Doe will get
   no media attention, but I am deathly afraid of revealing any
   information about myself or my family.I watched in horror as Trump
   vilified Dr. Blasey-Ford. I will not allow this abuse to be directed
   toward me.

   The typed version of her handwritten letter to Senator Kamala Harris:

   Dear, Senator Grassley, et al.

   The current situation regarding the accusations made by Dr. Ford
   against Brett Kavanaugh have prompted me to write you today. I have
   moved on with my life since he forced himself on me as well. The times
   were so different, and I didn’t expect to be taken seriously, embarrass
   my family, be believed at all. I was at a party with a friend. I had
   been drinking. She left with another boy, leaving me to find my own way
   home. Kavanaugh and a friend offered me a ride home. I don’t know the
   other boy’s name. I was in his car to go home. His friend was behind me
   in the backseat. Kavanaugh kissed me forcefully.

   I told him I only wanted a ride home. Kavanaugh continued to grope me
   over my clothes, forcing his kisses on me and putting his hand under my
   sweater. ‘No,’ I yelled at him. The boy in the backseat reached around,
   putting his hand over my mouth and holding my arm to keep me in the
   car. I screamed into his hand. Kavanaugh continued his forcing himself
   on me. He pulled up my sweater and bra exposing my breasts, and reached
   into my panties, inserting his fingers into my vagina. My screams were
   silenced by the boy in the backseat covering my mouth and groping me as
   well. Kavanaugh slapped me and told me to be quiet and forced me to
   perform oral sex on him. He climaxed in my mouth. They forced me to go
   into the backseat and took turns raping me several times each.

   They dropped me off two blocks from my home. ‘No one will believe if
   you tell. Be a good girl,’ he told me. Watching what has happened to
   Anita Hill and Dr. Ford has me petrified to come forward in person or
   even provide my name. A group of white men, powerful senators who won’t
   believe me, will come after me. Like Dr. Ford, I’m a teacher, I have an
   education, a family, a child, a home. I have credibility. Just because
   something happens a long time ago, because a rape victim doesn’t want
   to personally come forward, does not mean something can’t be true.

   Jane Doe, Oceanside, California.

   Daniel Stip, 22, pictured, dragged the pensioner into her home in
   Paignton, Devon and raped her before stealing her late husband's ashes,
   just days after trying to attack a 25-year-old woman who managed to
   fight him off

   A man who raped a pensioner he grabbed while she was putting her bins
   out before laughing and running off with her husband's ashes has been
   detained in hospital.

   Daniel Stip, 22, dragged the pensioner into her home in Paignton, Devon
   as she put her bins out on to the street ready for collection in
   January this year, a court heard.

   After raping her he laughed and stole a precious piece of jewellery
   containing her late husband's ashes, it was said.

   Just three days earlier he grabbed and attempted to rape a 25-year-old
   but she had fought him off, the court heard.

   At that time he was wanted by police in connection with another
   attempted rape of a Cambridge University student in September 2017.

   After his arrest Stip told police: 'I've killed, I've raped, I've
   stolen, everything.'

   Stip, a paranoid schizophrenic originally from South Africa, was given
   a hospital order by a judge at Exeter Crown Court who described him as
   a danger to the public.

   He said: 'It's clear on any view you're presently dangerous and present
   a significant risk of causing further sexual offences against women.

   'You conducted these actions against women who were strangers and while
   you were suffering from a serious mental disorder.'

   DNA evidence identified the 22-year-old and he was later arrested in
   Bristol.

   While under section in hospital he phoned police to confess his crimes.

   He told police: 'I've killed, I've raped, I've stolen, everything.

   'I only raped that lady so I could be an angel to the victims.

   'If I raped her then by karma I have to be the one that gets raped
   tenfold.'

   handed an indefinite hospital order after he pleaded guilty to rape,
   two attempted rapes, burglary and robbery

   The defendant appeared via video link for sentence at Exeter Crown
   Court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to rape, two attempted rapes,
   burglary and robbery.

   Stip was sentenced under Section 37 order of the Mental Health Act 1983
   and given an indefinite hospital order.

   Devon and Cornwall police detective sergeant Simon Lee, from the Sexual
   Offences and Domestic Abuse investigation Team, said: 'I welcome the
   sentencing of Daniel Stip today following a lengthy and complex
   investigation by South Devon Detectives.

   'He targeted lone women in attempts to fulfil his sexual desires and
   caused them to fear for their lives through violent and violating
   attacks.

   '[The] sentence reflects justice for his victims and the need for
   appropriate treatment to ensure he cannot prey on others.'

10-year-old girl raped by uncle in Shakarpur

   Monday, 05 November 2018 | Staff Reporter | NEW DELHI

   In a horrific incident, a 10-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her
   uncle in Shakarpur area of the National Capital on Sunday.

   According to a senior police official, the girl had gone to her aunt’s
   house, which was across the road from her place, where her 32-year-old
   uncle allegedly raped her.

   “The girl narrated her ordeal to her parents, following which the
   parents approached to the police,” said the senior police official.

   “We have registered a case and are waiting for the medical examination
   report.

   “The man is absconding and we are trying to trace him,” said the police
   official.

   According to sources, the girl had come to Delhi with her parents a few
   days ago.

   The girl hails from West Bengal. The parents of the victim work as
   labourers in the city.

   The accused is also a native of West Bengal and is married to the
   victim’s father’s sister,” said the source.

   Earlier on November 1, a 30-year-old cab driver was arrested for
   allegedly raping a minor girl, whom he had been dropping to school for
   the past two-three months.

   The incident was reported from east Delhi’s Madhu Vihar and the
   accused, a neighbour of the victim, was hired by her parents to drop
   her to school.

   A woman who said she was sexually assaulted by another passenger
   onboard an overnight American Airlines flight last year has sued the
   carrier in federal court.

   The complaint, filed Wednesday by Colorado resident Aubrey Lane,
   alleges American failed in its duty to protect her and other passengers
   by allowing a visibly drunk man to board a June 16, 2017 redeye flight
   from  Phoenix to New York, and continuing to serve him as many as six
   alcoholic drinks.

   The man, whose identity hasn’t been publicly disclosed, was seated next
   to Lane and harassed her throughout the flight, according to Lane and
   another passenger seated nearby. At some point during the flight, the
   man followed Lane to the plane’s bathroom where he sexually assaulted
   her, the lawsuit said.

   “Knowing the clear dangers of intoxication and the sexual assault
   threats, especially on red eye flights, American offered no protection
   to Aubrey Lane...despite the verbal warnings of Passenger 12C and the
   obvious obnoxious, aggressive, threatening and intoxicated behavior of
   Passenger 12B,” the complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court in New
   York, said.

   American Airlines’ spokesman Michelle Mohr said the company has yet to
   receive the lawsuit and will review the complaint once it does.

   “We are deeply troubled by any allegation of misconduct onboard
   our aircraft or at any of our facilities,” Mohr said.  "If our crews
   discover or are told about any alleged illegal misconduct that may
   occur on the aircraft, law enforcement is contacted and will meet the
   aircraft upon arrival...It is up to law enforcement to determine what,
   if any criminal activity, took place.”

   Airport police met with Lane at the gate after the plane landed, but
   her assailant was not apprehended at the time. Lane’s case was turned
   over to the FBI, which typically handles investigations of crimes that
   occur on aircraft, but the agency has declined to comment and no
   arrests have been made.
   She said she was raped on a flight. American Airlines called it a
   'nuisance claim.' Now, she's speaking out

   When Lane first approached the carrier about the incident last year, an
   American employee described it as a “nuisance claim” and offered $5,000
   as a settlement.

   The carrier later apologized for how it responded to Lane’s claim and
   said it has since put new procedures in place for following-up on
   reports of onboard disturbances, including sexual misconduct.

Lack of awareness

   Lane’s case is one of several that have called increasing attention to
   the issue of sexual assault and harassment aboard aircraft in the past
   year.

   Washington resident Allison Dvaladze sued Delta Air Lines earlier this
   year over its handling of a 2016 incident where a stranger sitting next
   to Dvaladze grabbed her crotch while she was falling asleep on an
   overnight flight to Europe.

   Last November, Randi Zuckerberg,  a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and
   sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, tweeted about explicit
   sexual comments made by a man sitting next to her on an Alaska Airlines
   flight, generating national headlines.

   Earlier this month, a Denton man was arrested after he allegedly
   harassed and touched a woman on a Los Angeles to Dallas Southwest
   flight.

   The Association of Flight Attendants has campaigned for greater
   awareness and training of flight crews to respond to in-flight sexual
   assault, a problem the group’s president has called a “silent
   epidemic.”
   [scaletowidth#tl-1030275933816225794;1043138249']

   A 2017 survey of nearly 2,000 flight attendants conducted by the union
   found that 1 in 5 had received reports of in-flight sexual assault or
   harassment during their careers. Most said they had no knowledge of
   written guidance or training on how to handle such reports, according
   to the union.

   The FBI, which typically investigates crime onboard aircraft, has also
   seen a rise in the number of sexual assaults reported on planes, from
   38 in 2014 up to 63 in the 12-months ending Sept. 30, 2017. The agency
   said many incidents go unreported.

   The awareness effort has made some progress, with a federal aviation
   bill passed earlier this month calling for the establishment of an
   industry task force to study and make recommendations to improve flight
   crew training and reporting of sexual misconduct on planes.

   emergency landing, Denton man's arrest

   Executives at Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have also spoken out
   on the issue in the last year, with Alaska Airlines adding new training
   for flight attendants aimed at preventing and addressing sexual
   harassment or assault.

The alcohol factor

   Lane’s case combines two elements experts say are frequently present in
   onboard sexual assaults -- alcohol and overnight flights.

   In an email to American Airlines executives sent a week after the
   incident, a woman sitting in the same row as Aubrey, identified only as
   Passenger 12C in the lawsuit, describes the man Lane said assaulted her
   as “stumbling” onto the plane.

   “He fumbled in the aisle, struggling to find his seat, and once seated,
   he immediately confessed that he had been drinking for hours, that we
   was very nervous to fly and that he needed a drink,” said the email,
   which was addressed to American’s CEO Doug Parker, senior vice
   president of customer experience Kerry Philipovitch and another
   customer relations manager. “This man was not fit to fly, but yet
   American Airlines allowed him to fly.”

   The woman said she watched as the man was served two vodkas, a beer and
   a soda, an order he repeated later in the flight. He began acting
   increasingly erratic, the woman said in the email, telling Lane he was
   “in love with her” and attempting to touch and kiss Lane over her
   objections.
   Flight attendants say they regularly face groping, lewd comments from
   passengers

   The woman said she alerted flight attendants twice that the man was
   making other passengers uncomfortable and it wasn’t until a third
   complaint, after the man had spilled his beer, that she and Lane were
   moved to different seats.

   Although she did not witness the assault, the woman said Lane’s
   demeanor changed about two hours in after returning from the bathroom,
   a period of time when the man was also away from his seat.

   The woman said she waited for Lane in the gate area after the plane
   landed, where Lane told her she had been sexually assaulted in the
   bathroom.

   “You may ask, and certainly the police did, ‘Why didn’t she report it
   to a flight attendant? In a nutshell, she was in shock,” the email to
   American executives read. “The flight crew had not stepped in prior to
   this, so I don’t blame her for not placing a lot of trust in their
   action to respond.”

Protecting passengers

   Lane’s lawsuit alleges American Airlines failed to follow its own
   safety policies as well as federal regulations that bar airlines from
   allowing passengers who “appear to be intoxicated” to board an
   aircraft. Federal guidelines also prohibit continuing to serve
   alcoholic drinks to passengers who appear to be intoxicated.

   The suit argues that American was negligent and breached the duty of
   care it owes passengers to ensure their safe travel by allowing Lane’s
   assailant to board the plane and continuing to serve him drinks,
   despite warnings about his behavior from a passenger.

   Lane’s attorneys said communication with American has been
   “non-existent” since earlier this year. While the FBI investigation is
   still active to the best of their knowledge, Lane’s attorneys said they
   couldn’t wait any longer to take action against the carrier.

   “The bottom line is, American Airlines’ number one priority is supposed
   to be passenger safety,” said attorney Meg Foley. “They failed
   miserably here.”

Spiritual Leader Raped 2 Women During Ceremonies, Prosecutors Say

   prosecutors said.CreditCreditBrooklyn District Attorney’s Office

   A 42-year-old woman went to a Brooklyn apartment in August 2016 to meet
   a self-described spiritual leader for what she thought was a “church
   ceremony.” She had met him at a religious goods store.

   During the ceremony, the man, Nigel Kennedy, started chanting and
   poured a drink that tasted like alcohol into the woman’s mouth,
   prosecutors said. She passed out briefly, then regained consciousness
   and felt someone on top of her. The next morning she awoke naked on an
   unfamiliar bed, feeling nauseous and dizzy, and realized she had been
   raped, prosecutors said.

   Mr. Kennedy, 51, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in State Supreme Court
   in Brooklyn to charges of rape and sexual abuse. He is accused of
   drugging and raping two women in Brooklyn during separate religious
   ceremonies two years apart, and faces up to 25 years in prison if
   convicted of the top charge. Justice William Miller set Mr. Kennedy’s
   bail at $35,000, which he posted.

   “This defendant is a sexual predator who used his religious stature to
   lure women, then drugged and raped them,” the Brooklyn district
   attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said in a statement.

   The most recent attack was in May, prosecutors said, when Mr. Kennedy
   held another “spiritual reading” for a 28-year-old woman in his home in
   East Flatbush. After blowing smoke in her face, he poured a liquid that
   tasted like alcohol into her mouth; she threw up, but he forced her to
   drink the liquid again, prosecutors said, and she later lost
   consciousness. When she woke, Mr. Kennedy was having sex with her,
   prosecutors said. She told him to stop, but he told her, “relax, it’s
   part of the ritual.”

   Reached by telephone, Mr. Kennedy declined to comment on the
   allegations on Wednesday afternoon. The telephone number is linked
   through records to the Psychic Kaballah Network. On its website, the
   business offers the assistance of a “proven international famed
   Kaballah master” who uses “mystical magic” to help people achieve their
   desires.

   A voice mail message greeting for the business suggested that the
   business offered “prayer, deliverance” and “spiritual cleansing or
   healing.”

   Among the services listed on the Psychic Kaballah Network’s site are
   spiritual readings, predictions for the future, protection and casting
   away of evil spirits, and help to “resolve court cases victoriously.”

   The Psychic Kaballah Network’s site claims the business operates with
   “certified psychics.” It also offers spells — described as being so
   effective at getting even with enemies that customers shouldn’t request
   them unless “absolutely necessary” — and magical objects that can
   protect against harm.

   Mr. Kennedy previously owned a storefront religious goods shop in East
   Flatbush that no longer operates, the district attorney’s office said.
   He met both women there.

   The women sought medical attention soon after the alleged attacks and
   forensic evidence was collected, prosecutors said. The second victim
   later identified Mr. Kennedy as her attacker, and he was arrested in
   early September after flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport
   from Trinidad.

   A grand jury handed up the 13-count indictment on Sept. 20, charging
   him with first- and third-degree rape and first- and second-degree
   sexual abuse, prosecutors said. Mr. Kennedy has no prior arrests, a
   police spokesman said.

24 Years Later, Woman Who Was Maligned After Rape Gets Apology From Police
Commissioner

   DNA.CreditCreditMark Lennihan/Associated Press

   It took 24 years, but a woman who was raped in a Brooklyn park and then
   maligned by police officials and a columnist who doubted her story has
   received what she wanted: a formal apology from the New York City
   police commissioner.

   The commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said in a letter released on Sunday
   that the treatment of the woman and the handling of the case amounted
   to a “miscarriage of justice.”

   Police officials, quoted by a columnist in The Daily News, cast
   aspersions on the woman’s report of being dragged off a path in
   Prospect Park in broad daylight and raped at knife point on April 26,
   1994. Investigators then allowed the case to languish for decades after
   a lab report showed they had been wrong.

   Mr. O’Neill wrote in a letter to the woman that the police had “let her
   down in almost every possible way,” compounding her pain. “For that,”
   he added, “I am deeply and profoundly sorry.”

   It was a remarkable admission of failure by the head of the nation’s
   largest police department, which has struggled recently with
   shortcomings in the Special Victims Division that investigates sex
   crimes.

   Rarely do big-city police commissioners publicly apologize, and Mr.
   O’Neill’s letter seemed to reflect a cultural shift in attitudes toward
   victims of sexual assault and harassment, fanned by the #MeToo
   movement. Mr. O’Neill, a career police officer, has staked his legacy
   on building trust with communities wary of the police.

   The woman, who is African-American and now 52 years old, said in an
   interview that the apology left her feeling grateful and unexpectedly
   emotional.

   “I wanted to see this happen so that the N.Y.P.D. would have to take a
   public stance in support of survivors, so that there would be a public
   statement that would make it clear that it was safe and beneficial for
   survivors to come forward to the police, and that they would not be
   attacked or pilloried by the police,” she said.

   “I was very caught by surprise to see that acknowledged in black and
   white.”

   The commissioner at the time, William J. Bratton, apologized three days
   after the attack for the police role in airing investigators’ doubts
   publicly. But Mr. O’Neill went further, saying they were wrong to doubt
   her in the first place.

   Sonia Ossorio, the president of the New York City arm of the National
   Organization for Women, called the apology “unprecedented.”

   “It’s meaningful to all survivors, and it sends a message,” she said.
   “You can’t move forward until you recognize and acknowledge what has
   been failing. And it really is our greatest hope that this translates
   into a new era for the N.Y.P.D. and police departments across the
   country.”

   The case became a flash point after police officials told the
   columnist, Mike McAlary, that the woman had made up the attack to
   promote a rally for lesbian and gay rights. At the time, the woman said
   she was a lesbian. She now describes herself as bisexual. Nora Ephron
   explored the case in the play “Lucky Guy,” which ran on Broadway in
   2013 with Tom Hanks playing Mr. McAlary.

   The doubts raised in 1994 about the account by the survivor of the
   Prospect Park rape drove a wedge between the police and the overlapping
   communities of sexual assault victims and lesbian and gay people. Mr.
   O’Neill lamented that divide in his letter, singling out the hoax
   accusation as “egregious.”

   “I firmly believe that no one in the N.Y.P.D. would draw such an
   implausible and ridiculous conclusion today,” he added.

   The Police Department reopened the investigation a year ago after
   accusations of sexual assault against the movie producer Harvey
   Weinstein were published, fueling the rise of the #MeToo movement,
   which has felled the careers of more than 200 powerful men and forced a
   national reckoning about consent, sexual assault and believing women
   who make complaints.

   The issues took center stage last month as Christine Blasey Ford
   testified against a judge, Brett M. Kavanaugh, at his confirmation
   hearing for a seat on the Supreme Court.

   When Mr. O’Neill met with advocates for women during the uproar over
   Mr. Weinstein, they told him the Prospect Park case still “cried out
   for acknowledgment,” Ms. Ossorio said.

   time has lapsed under the law on the books at that time.CreditNew York
   State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, via
   Associated Press

   In January, semen on the woman’s shorts led officials to identify the
   woman’s attacker as James Edward Webb, a serial rapist who was already
   imprisoned for subsequent attacks on other women. Too much time had
   passed to charge him under a state law that has since been repealed.

   John Miller, a former police spokesman who is now the deputy police
   commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, later apologized
   after The New York Times published a letter from the woman, who said he
   owed it to her.

   Mr. Miller acknowledged that he had been unfair to the woman when, as
   the police spokesman at the time, he revealed that investigators had
   doubts about the woman’s credibility.

   In a column that appeared two days after the attack, Mr. McAlary cited
   unnamed police officials who questioned her account, under the
   headline: “Rape Hoax the Real Crime.” Mr. McAlary, who died of cancer
   in 1998, wrote, “The woman, who will probably end up being arrested
   herself, invented the crime, they said, to promote her rally.”

   When the semen was found, Mr. McAlary wrote that a police official had
   deemed the laboratory wrong. It turned out, however, that top police
   officials involved in the case had misunderstood the technical language
   of the lab report.

   The woman’s DNA had commingled with her attacker’s, and the technology
   that allowed investigators to identify Mr. Webb more than two decades
   later had not been developed. The case went cold, and Mr. Webb raped at
   least four more women.

   The woman filed a libel suit against Mr. McAlary and The Daily News in
   Manhattan Supreme Court that Justice Charles Ramos dismissed in 1997
   after she could not prove the columnist had acted maliciously. Mr.
   Miller gave a deposition on behalf of Mr. McAlary.

   “I am very disappointed that John Miller has never been held
   accountable for the unconscionable statements he made,” the woman said,
   “and all that followed from them.”

   Her lawyer, Martin Garbus, said Mr. O’Neill’s “fantastic” apology was
   undermined by his decision not to take action against officials still
   in the department who damaged the case.

   “The institution takes it on the chin,” Mr. Garbus said. “He’s
   protecting his people there, and he’s protecting sexism and racism.”

   Public apologies often require police officials to walk a fine line
   between admitting mistakes and criticizing the work of their officers.
   Mr. O’Neill drew a backlash from police labor unions in 2016 after he
   said the police had failed when Deborah Danner, a 66-year-old mentally
   ill woman in the Bronx, was shot and killed by a sergeant. The
   sergeant, Hugh Barry, said he had acted in self-defense and was later
   acquitted of murder.

   Other police leaders have expressed regret for their officers’ actions:
   Philadelphia’s police commissioner, Richard Ross, apologized to two
   black men who were arrested while waiting for a business partner at a
   Starbucks, one of several recent instances that have gone viral on
   social media of white people calling the police on black people who
   were doing nothing wrong. The department later changed its arrest
   policy for trespassing.

   Since accusations against Mr. Weinstein became public, more people have
   come forward to the police with complaints about their own
   victimization, and officials have noted an increase among people
   reporting attacks from previous years. As of Oct. 25, the Police
   Department had received 1,487 rape complaints, up nearly 27 percent
   from the 1,178 it had gotten during the same time frame last year. One
   out of every four rapes reported this year was from a prior year,
   compared with one of about every six rapes in 2017.

   A Department of Investigation report in March found that its Special
   Victims Division was understaffed and its investigators poorly trained
   and overworked.

   Mary Haviland, the executive director of the New York City Alliance
   Against Sexual Assault, said the report was devastating to advocates
   who thought the department was trying harder to solve sex crimes.

   After initially rejecting the D.O.I. report, the Police Department
   announced that it was devoting more resources to the unit, including
   hiring more than 36 investigators, just over half of the number the
   report recommended. The police also started “The Call Is Yours,” a
   public service campaign on subways, buses and social media encouraging
   survivors to report their experiences.

   Sexual assault survivors have said the department could still do
   better. Ms. Haviland said their frustrating experiences in having their
   complaints investigated spoke to a need to strengthen the sex crimes
   unit with more experienced investigators and to protect its case
   management system from leaks.

   The City Council is preparing to vote Monday on a legislative package
   that would require the Police Department to put the report’s
   recommendations in effect. The measures include a bill that would
   require all police officers to receive sensitivity training.

   Susan Herman, the deputy commissioner for collaborative policing, said
   the police planned more changes. The apology, while long in the making,
   was an important step, she said, adding, “It’s never too late to do the
   right thing.”

Over 200 raped per month in Congo conflict, report says


   By Max BearakThe Washington Post

Saturday

   Nov 3, 2018 at 6:42 PM Nov 3, 2018 at 6:42 PM

   NAIROBI, Kenya -- A brutal war has raged for over two years in southern
   Congo's Kasai province. It is a region that is difficult to access for
   aid organizations due to its remoteness, hostility from the government
   and, of course, the violence itself. Two United Nations investigators,
   an American and a Swede, were killed there around the beginning of the
   conflict in 2016.

   One of the few groups that is present is Doctors Without Borders,
   commonly known by its French acronym, MSF. It released a report last
   week that documents a disturbingly high rate of sexual violence
   perpetrated by armed groups in Kasai. Rapes are being committed many
   times a day, and MSF has treated more than 200 victims of sexual
   violence per month on average since May 2017. Eighty percent of victims
   said they were raped by armed men.

   "Of the 2,600 victims of sexual violence treated by MSF since May 2017,
   the vast majority were women," says the report. "Thirty-two were men,
   some of whom reported having been forced under armed threat to rape
   members of their own community. Another 162 were children under the age
   of 15, including 22 under the age of five."

   The war in Kasai began in August 2016 when a local traditional leader
   hostile to the central government was killed. A militia named after
   him, called Kamuina Nsapu, began to target Congo's national army, which
   in turn employed another local militia called Bana Mura to suppress the
   rebellion.

   The conflict has been characterized by its brutality.

   By Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times - Saturday, November 3, 2018

   One of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s accusers admitted this week that
   she made up her lurid tale of a backseat car rape, saying it “was a
   tactic” to try to derail the judge’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.

   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee revealed
   the fraud in a letter to the FBI and Justice Department Friday, asking
   them to prosecute Judy Munro-Leighton for lying to and obstructing
   Congress.

   Mr. Grassley said Ms. Munro-Leighton is a left-wing activist who
   hijacked another “Jane Doe” anonymous report about a backseat rape and
   claimed it as her own story, calling it a “vicious assault.”

   2018
     __________________________________________________________________

   “I am Jane Doe from Oceanside CA — Kavanaugh raped me,” Ms.
   Munro-Leighton wrote in an Oct. 3 email claiming to have been a victim
   of the judge.

   Mr. Grassley’s investigators tried to reach her for a month but were
   unsuccessful until this week, when they spoke to her by phone and she
   confessed that she was not the original Jane Doe, and “did that as a
   way to grab attention.”

   She admitted to the false allegation, and said she has actually never
   met Justice Kavanaugh.

   “I was angry, and I sent it out,” she told investigators.

   “In short, during the committee’s time-sensitive investigation of
   allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Munro-Leighton submitted a
   fabricated allegation, which diverted committee resources,” Mr.
   Grassley wrote. “When questioned by Committee investigators she
   admitted it was false, a ‘ploy,’ and a ‘tactic.’ She was opposed to
   Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation.”

   President Trump seized on the report Saturday, calling her “a vicious
   accuser.”

   “What about the others? Where are the Dems on this?” he demanded via
   Twitter.

   Mr. Grassley has previously asked the FBI to probe Julie Swetnick and
   her lawyer, anti-Trump crusader Michael Avenatti, for lying to Congress
   and obstructing. Ms. Swetnick had originally claimed to have been the
   victim of gang rapes involving Justice Kavanaugh during high school
   parties, saying she saw him and a friend spike punch to leave girls
   unable to resist. She later changed her story to say she saw Justice
   Kavanaugh and his friend near a punch bowl, and could not identify them
   as having actually been part of any rape.

   None of the witnesses she told NBC could corroborate her story were
   able to do so.

   Indeed, NBC found one woman who despite a sworn statement backing up
   Ms. Swetnick, told the network Mr. Avenatti was twisting her words.

   Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was delayed while the
   committee investigated a number of sexual assault and harassment
   claims, none of which have been corroborated by any public evidence to
   date.

   He vehemently denied all of the claims.

   He was confirmed, though only one Democrat joined with all but one
   Republican in backing him.

   Man facing charges after pizza delivery drivers kidnapped

   MONTGOMERY COUNTY — Two female pizza delivery drivers were kidnapped,
   one of whom was raped, in two separate incidents and now a Dayton man
   is facing multiple felonies for the alleged crimes.

   D'ablo McConnell, 19, was indicted by a grand jury Monday on four
   counts of kidnapping, two counts of rape and single counts of attempted
   rape, assault and aggravated robbery.

   McConnell had a not guilty plea entered on Thursday and his bond was
   set at $250,000.

   McConnell allegedly kidnapped a victim at gunpoint in the first block
   of Sandhurst Drive in Dayton on Oct. 17 around 11:45 p.m., records
   showed.

   The teen then was accused of forcing the victim to drive him in her car
   to the area of Taywood Drive, where he allegedly raped her, courts
   records showed.

   Englewood police said they are investigating a similar case that was
   reported the next night around 10:45 p.m.

   In the Englewood case, McConnell was accused of holding a “realistic
   gun” to a different female victim’s head on West Wenger Road and
   allegedly forced her to drive him in her car to the area of Hillcrest
   Avenue. McConnell was then accused of robbing her and attempted to rape
   her, a criminal complaint read.

   The victim in the Englewood case was able to escape before being raped
   and attempted to flee, however McConnell allegedly choked the victim
   until she passed out, court records read.
   McConnell is expected to be arraigned on the indicted charges Thursday
   and remains in the Montgomery County Jail.

            Lawsuit filed in alleged Myers Park High School rape
       CHARLOTTE, N.C. - “Help me."
       "Guys, I'm being serious. I'm really scared."
       "Mom, I’m being kidnapped. Call somebody."
       Those are some of the text messages a former Myers Park High School
       student sent to classmates and family during an alleged abduction
       and rape back in 2015 that happened right near the school.
       [ CMPD cold case unit arrests suspect in 1992 rape case ]
       In the nearly 30-page civil suit, an unidentified girl (“Jane Doe”)
       claims that she was walking with student “Q.W.” one school morning
       on campus, and he was pressuring her to skip class, which she
       declined.
       According to court documents, the two were spotted by school
       resource officer Bradley Leak, and he called out to Doe, asking her
       where she was going.
       It also states Q.W. "immediately grabbed and squeezed" Doe’s arm
       and pulled her toward the woods next to campus, despite her verbal
       protest. That's when, according to the lawsuit, the girl started
       sending those frantic texts.  Shortly after, she describes being
       raped by Q.W.
       The suit claims both a friend and the girl's father contacted Leak
       as they were getting these distraught texts, but nothing was done.
       In addition, Leak told the girl’s father that he saw the two leave
       campus and he believed she was skipping class on her own.
       [myerspark-rapelawsuit_1541191493664_13565686_ver1.0_320_240.jpg]
       Eventually, after another call from her parents, the suit states
       Leak and the assistant principal at the time, Anthony Perkins, went
       to look for her and found the two students outside the woods.
       The lawsuit stated, "Her hair was in disarray, she had mud on her
       clothing, her glasses were broken and there was semen on her
       shirt."
       According to the suit, both students were told to sit in the patrol
       car together. When Q.W. was taken out, Doe told the officer she was
       sexually assaulted.
       However, according to the lawsuit, "None of the defendants took a
       statement from her to investigate or resolve the complaint as
       required under Title IX."
       According to the lawsuit, her parents took her to the hospital and
       contacted police.
       Channel 9 tried contacting all parties involved. According to the
       city of Charlotte's website, Leak is employed by the
       Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.
       CMPD officials said they had just received the complaint and that
       it will be reviewed and responded to within the judicial system.
       Officials with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools stated they are unable
       to provide comment on current or pending litigation.

   ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio (WTRF) - The 11-year-old girl was raped in
   Belmont County.

   And the suspect, who has recently turned 18, has admitted to one count
   of rape and will soon be sentenced.

   Now the child's father reveals the shocking twists and turns in the
   case.

   It's the story of one boy, two sisters, and a family that has been torn
   apart.

   It's complicated and shocking, but the younger girl's father says every
   parent needs to hear it.

   Chris Feaster's daughter was 11 when it happened.

   Feaster says Evan Porter of St. Clairsville was at the house a lot,
   dating her older sister, age 17.

   "They got real close and everything," said Feaster, referring to the
   older sister and Porter. "They ended up having a baby. Evan became real
   close with the family."

   But Feaster says in the middle of the night, Porter would sneak out of
   the older sister's bedroom, and seek out the 11-year-old.

   "He would sneak and creep into where my daughter used to sleep, and
   that's where all the awful things happened," Feaster said.

   Now Porter is awaiting sentencing for the one count of rape he admitted
   to.

   And Feaster says his once-outgoing daughter who loved swimming and
   sports has now isolated herself in her room.

   He says she gets bullied at school.

   "People are telling her she should kill herself," he noted.

   Feaster says he would have liked to see Porter tried on all five
   original counts, rather than pleading to a single count,

   But now he has advice to parents everywhere.

   "Don't be your child's friend; be a parent," he says.

   "When you're not a home, there shouldn't be boys--or girls--in the
   house," Feaster advises. "And when you're going to bed, make sure that
   the doors are locked, windows are locked and everybody's out of the
   house."

   He says the older sister has moved out.

   She no longer speaks to the younger sister.

   And Evan Porter could be sentenced to 11 years in prison.

   "It's torn the family apart," said Feaster.

   Feaster himself readily admits he spent two-and-a-half years in prison
   for a drug charge years ago.

   He says now he wants all kids to have clear boundaries.

   OAP RAPE

Homeless drifter raped woman in her 70s then stole her necklace with
husband’s ashes

   Daniel Stip's victim begged him not to take her memento and despite
   extensive searches during the investigation it was never recovered

   A HOMELESS man raped a widow in her 70s and then stole her necklace
   that had her husband’s ashes in it.

   Daniel Stip, 22, led the woman inside her Devon home where he raped
   her.
   Daniel Stip pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an indefinite hospital
   order

   The victim begged Stip not to take her memento, which was never
   recovered despite extensive searches during the investigation.

   The homeless drifter attacked the OAP early in the morning in January
   2018.

   Stip was identified through DNA evidence and was later arrested in
   Bristol.

   He had also attacked another woman that month in the same area.

   A woman in her 20s was grabbed from behind and assaulted in Paignton.

   She managed to break free when her screams caused him to flee the
   scene.

   Police enquiries in the area were able to link Stip to that offence.

   He was also previously charged with robbery and attempted rape of a
   woman in her 20s in September 2017.

   The victim was walking home in Cambridgeshire when he approached her on
   a bike and attempted to sexually assault her before taking cash.

   Forensic evidence in that case led to the identification of Stip.

   Stip, who has no fixed address, pleaded guilty to one count of rape,
   two counts of attempted rape, one count of burglary and one count of
   robbery.

   He was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court on Friday to an indefinite
   hospital order.

   Devon and Cornwall Police Detective Sergeant Simon Lee said Stip’s
   sentence is to ensure he gets treatment so he cannot “prey on others”
   as his victim’s lives “have been changed forever”.

   He added: “He has proven himself to be a dangerous individual who
   preyed on victims across the country.

   "He targeted lone women in attempts to fulfil his sexual desires and
   caused them to fear for their lives through violent and violating
   attacks.”

   “I would like to thank the victims of these awful crimes for reporting
   them to police and recognise their strength of character throughout a
   protracted investigation.

   "I must also recognise how traumatic this time has been for all three
   victims, whose lives have been changed forever.

   “I hope that the outcome of this investigation will encourage victims
   of similar crimes to come forward and report them to police so that we
   can investigate and seek justice for them too.”

   PURE EVIL

I was raped by dad from the age of eight – but after telling police I
APOLOGISED to him

   Caryn Walker waived her anonymity to tell her shocking story
   By Anna Roberts
   4th November 2018, 1:22 pm
   Updated: 4th November 2018, 1:26 pm

   A WOMAN has told how she bought her rapist dad to justice – but not
   before apologising to him for contacting the police.

   Caryn Walker’s evil dad Norman Yeo first abused her when she was just
   eight by showing her pictures of naked women in porn mags.

   He told her “you’ll be like that soon,” the Daily Mirror reported.

   He then moved onto to touching and raping her, carrying on until her
   mid-teens.

   But it was not until her big sister Jenny died aged 36 of a brain
   aneurysm that she went to the police.

   Now 47-year-old Caryn, from Liverpool, has told her story in a memoir
   called: Tell Me You’re Sorry, Daddy.

   In it she revealed how Jenny told her that, aged 16, their dad would
   visit her in her first flat and “demand sex”.

   Caryn told the Mirror: “Our childhoods were just awful but the sad
   thing is, I thought the way we lived was normal.

   “No one ever told me they loved me, or read me a bedtime story. I was
   in my twenties before anyone gave me a hug.

   “I hated every second of what my dad did to me. I was so little and it
   was so painful but he lied and told me all dads did this to their
   daughters.

   “I never thought I’d find the courage to go to the police. I assumed
   these terrible things must somehow be my fault. I’m speaking out for
   Jenny.

   “She always said she wanted to write a book about what happened to us
   but now it’s up to me.”

   I hated every second of what my dad did to me. I was so little and it
   was so painful but he lied and told me all dads did this to their
   daughters.
   Caryn Walker

   Caryn, mum to Karl, 29, added how it was a chance meeting with her dad,
   at a nursing home while she was visiting her gran in 2010 that prompted
   her to take action.

   She visited police and he was arrested on suspicion of abusing her.  In
   2011 it it took jurors at Liverpool Crown Court just two hours to
   convict Yeo, then 63, of Liverpool, of eight offences of rape and five
   charges of indecent assault.

   He had admitted 10 charges of indecent assault.

   Jailing him for 16 years, Judge John Phipps said: “This case concerns
   regular, repeated systematic abuse. You are disgusted with yourself…
   and so you should be”

   Caryn told the Liverpool Echo: “I was so damaged at that time that I
   actually called Norman and apologised – not for going to the police but
   because other members of the family now knew about it.”
